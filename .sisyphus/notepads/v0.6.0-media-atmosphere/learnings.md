## Mythos Atmosphere Integration
- Integrated `mythos-atmosphere.css` into `frontend/app/mythos/page.tsx`.
- Added fog overlays (`.fog-overlay`, `.fog-overlay-deep`) for depth.
- Applied `blood-glow` to the Hero badge and `text-glow` to the main title.
- Enhanced cards with `card-hover-effect` and `glass-enhanced`.
- Implemented staggered fade-in animations (`animate-fade-in`, `animate-delay-*`) for sections.
- Added `border-glow-animate` to connection badges.
- Verified with `bun run typecheck` and `bun run build`.
