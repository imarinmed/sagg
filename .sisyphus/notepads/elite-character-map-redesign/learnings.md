## Phone System Components
- Created `PhotoGallery.tsx` in `frontend/components/phone-system/lock-screen/`
- Implemented swipeable photo contexts (portrait, gym, school, spa, class)
- Added quality filter system (poor/average/good/excellent)
- Integrated with `TouchGestureZone` for swipe handling
- Used `framer-motion` for smooth transitions
