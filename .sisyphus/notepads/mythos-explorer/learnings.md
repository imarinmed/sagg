## Mythos Explorer Implementation
- Created `/app/mythos/explorer/page.tsx` as a dedicated visualization page.
- Used `LoreConnectionGraph` component with client-side data fetching.
- Implemented atmospheric effects consistent with the mythos section (fog overlays, glass cards).
- Added navigation link from the main mythos page.
- Encountered and fixed type issues with HeroUI Button props (`startContent`, `color`, `isIconOnly` seem to be different in this version or require specific usage).
- Ensured no comments in the final code to adhere to strict policy.
