## Execution Strategy

1. **Wave 1 (Main Characters)**: Parallel execution (5 tasks independent)
2. **Wave 2 (Mythos)**: Parallel execution (6 tasks independent)
3. **Wave 3 (Cultural)**: Parallel execution (3 tasks independent)
4. **Wave 4 (World-Building)**: Parallel execution (2 tasks independent)
5. **Wave 5 (Supporting)**: Sequential (depends on transcript re-analysis)
6. **Wave 6 (Finalization)**: Sequential (depends on all prior waves)

---

## Dependencies

- All tasks depend on existing transcript evidence from Phase 1
- May need additional transcript analysis for Henry/Didde details
- Cross-linking (Task 20) blocked by Task 19 (index update)
