    description: 'In the dark adaptation, mind control becomes explicitly tied to domination and consent violation. The ability to override another''s will creates perfect predator-prey dynamics. Some vampires use it sparingly, aware of the ethical implications. Others use it constantly, surrounding themselves with thralls who exist only to serve.'
    traits:
    - consent_violation_tool
    - creates_thralls
    - addictive_to_user
    - victim_awareness_varies
    - psychological_scarring_possible
    significance: 'Mind control represents the ultimate power imbalance. How can consent exist when one party can simply overwrite the other''s will? Yet some humans seek this out, craving the escape from choice.'
    mechanics: 'Eye contact initiates connection. Stronger commands require more sustained contact. Repeated use on same subject makes them more susceptible. Effects last hours to days depending on command strength. Victims may or may not remember being controlled.'
    erotic_implications: 'Mind control eliminates resistance, creating perfectly compliant partners—but some vampires find this hollow. The ethical vampires avoid it entirely in intimate situations. Others use it as the ultimate domination fantasy, their partners eager and willing because they''ve been made to be. The most disturbing use it to make victims forget, creating relationships built on violated memories.'
