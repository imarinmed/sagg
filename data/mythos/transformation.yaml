    description: 'The process by which humans become vampires. Not explicitly detailed
      in the series,

      but implied to involve blood exchange and a death-like transition. Once transformed,

      there is no return to humanity—the change is permanent and absolute.


      Transformation creates a bond between sire and progeny, with the new vampire
      emerging

      into their maker''s family with all the obligations that entails. The decision
      to

      transform someone is never taken lightly, as it creates an eternal connection.'

    description: 'In the dark adaptation, transformation is explicitly violent and
      sexual. The sire

      must drain the human nearly to death, then share their blood in an act of reverse

      feeding. The transition involves a death—the human dies, and what wakes is something

      else wearing their face. Many new vampires struggle with what they''ve lost.'

    - loss_of_humanity
    - hunger_upon_waking
    - eternal_servitude_to_sire

    significance: 'Transformation raises the ultimate consent question: the human
      agrees to transform,

      but the creature that wakes is not quite them. Did they consent to becoming
      a predator?

      To losing their human life, loves, future? The power dynamic between sire and
      new

      progeny mirrors abusive relationships, with the progeny dependent on their maker

      for knowledge, protection, and often feeding in those first vulnerable nights.'
    mechanics: 'Transformation requires the human to be drained past the point of
      no return, then

      fed vampire blood while the heart still weakly beats. The process takes three
      nights:

      the first night the human dies, the second they sleep in the earth, the third
      they

      rise as vampire. The sire must stay close during this time, as their blood calls

      to the awakening progeny.'
    erotic_implications: 'Transformation is the ultimate consummation. Sires often
      choose lovers to turn,

      creating an eternal partner bound to them by blood. The act itself—draining,

      feeding, the three nights of intimacy—is intensely sexual for both parties.

      Some vampires describe their transformation as the most erotic experience of

      their existence, colored by the terror and ecstasy of death.'
