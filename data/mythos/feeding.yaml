    The act of consuming blood for sustenance. Vampires require blood to survive, though the
    exact mechanics and frequency are not detailed in the series. What is clear is that feeding
    is both a biological necessity and an intimate act that carries profound significance.
    
    The series suggests feeding creates connections between vampire and donor, with repeated
    feeding from the same source building emotional bonds. The act itself appears to be
    pleasurable for both parties under the right circumstances.

adaptation_expansion:
  dark_variant: |
    In the dark adaptation, feeding becomes explicitly sexualized. The act of penetrating
    skin, the rush of blood, the shared pleasure—feeding mirrors and often accompanies
    sexual intimacy. Vampires who deny this connection are either lying or dangerously repressed.
  mechanics: |
    Vampire saliva contains compounds that numb pain and induce euphoria. A skilled feeder
    can make the experience purely pleasurable, while a cruel one can weaponize the pain.
    The bite location matters: neck feeding is intimate, wrist is practical, thigh is explicitly
    sexual. Inner thigh and femoral access is reserved for the most trusted or claimed donors.
  erotic_implications: |
    Feeding can range from clinical sustenance to the most intimate act a vampire can share.
    Many vampires only feed during sex, finding the combination of penetration irresistible.
    The power exchange inherent in feeding—one partner entirely vulnerable while the other
    takes what they need—mirrors many dynamics explored in BDSM communities.

  taboo_potential: |
    Feeding blurs lines between nutrition, intimacy, and violation. The same act that
    can be loving can be weaponized as assault. The addictive nature of vampire saliva
    raises consent questions: can a donor truly choose freely after experiencing
    vampire feeding's euphoria?
