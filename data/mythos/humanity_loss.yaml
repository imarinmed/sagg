    description: 'The longer a vampire exists, the more their human psychology erodes. Empathy for mortals fades—their lives seem brief and inconsequential. Moral frameworks developed as humans lose relevance. What once horrified becomes acceptable, then normal, then unremarkable. Ancient vampires often view humans as pets, livestock, or amusing toys rather than people. This loss isn''t inevitable but requires conscious effort to resist.'

    description: 'In the dark adaptation, humanity loss affects not just morality but sexuality and relationships. As empathy fades, vampires increasingly view partners as objects for pleasure rather than persons. Consent becomes technical rather than meaningful. Older vampires often maintain harems of thralls, humans they''ve reduced to willing slaves through mind control and blood bonds. They feel no guilt about this—humans are simply resources to be used.'
    traits:
    - objectification_of_partners
    - technical_consent_only
    - harem_mentality
    - exploitation_normalized
    - humans_as_resources
    significance: 'Humanity loss creates moral monsters who perform acts they genuinely don''t recognize as wrong. They maintain sophisticated social facades while viewing everyone around them as potential food or entertainment.'
    mechanics: 'Humanity erodes gradually: decades to notice, centuries to complete. Rate varies by individual—some resist for millennia, others surrender in decades. Maintaining human connections slows erosion. Isolation and repeated atrocity accelerate it. Once lost, humanity rarely returns. The vampire becomes functionally sociopathic, retaining intelligence and social skills but losing genuine empathy.'
    erotic_implications: 'Vampires who''ve lost humanity become perfect predators in intimate contexts. They read desire flawlessly, manipulate expertly, perform skillfully—but feel nothing genuine. Partners become interchangeable. Cruelty can be inflicted without remorse if it provides novelty or pleasure. These vampires may maintain long-term relationships purely for convenience, providing perfect lover performance while incapable of actual love. The most dangerous are those who lost humanity so long ago they no longer remember feeling differently—they genuinely don''t understand what they''re missing.'
