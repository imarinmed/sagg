    description: 'A mystical connection formed through blood exchange between vampires.
      The exact nature is not

      fully explored in the series, but hints suggest deep emotional and possibly
      telepathic links

      form between bonded parties.


      Blood bonds appear to transcend ordinary relationships, creating connections
      that persist

      across centuries and can only be severed by death—and perhaps not even then.
      The bond

      carries obligations, creating a web of loyalty and dependency that structures
      vampire society.'

    description: 'In the dark adaptation, blood bonds become intensely possessive.
      The bonded can feel each

      other''s pleasure and pain, creating opportunities for both exquisite shared
      experiences

      and cruel manipulations. Breaking a bond is not just difficult—it''s psychologically
      devastating.'

    - death_of_bonded_causes_madness
    significance: 'Blood bonds blur the lines of individual identity. When you can
      feel your partner''s

      desires as your own, where does consent begin? The power dynamics in bonds between

      vampires of different ages raise troubling questions about manipulation and
      control.'
    mechanics: 'Three exchanges create a partial bond. Seven exchanges create a full
      bond. Full bonds

      allow emotional and sensory sharing. The older vampire in a bond typically has
      more

      control over the connection, able to send sensations while blocking reception.'
    erotic_implications: 'Blood bonds transform intimacy into a shared experience.
      When bonded vampires feed from

      each other during sex, both feel the pleasure of giving and receiving. This
      creates

      unprecedented levels of connection—and vulnerability. Some vampires become addicted

      to bonded feeding, unable to find satisfaction in ordinary encounters.'
