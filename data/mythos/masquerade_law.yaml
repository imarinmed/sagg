    description: 'The First Law: Vampires must not reveal their existence to humanity. This ancient law exists for survival—organized humanity with modern weapons could threaten even powerful vampires. Violations are punished severely, often by death. The law extends beyond simple secrecy: vampires must clean up evidence, dispose of bodies properly, maintain plausible human identities, and eliminate witnesses when necessary. Regional vampire councils enforce the Masquerade ruthlessly.'

    description: 'In the dark adaptation, Masquerade Law has explicit sexual dimension: humans who become intimate partners may learn the truth, but they must be bound (blood bond, thrall state, or death) to ensure silence. This creates power imbalance in vampire-human relationships—the human learns dangerous truth and must accept permanent binding or die. Some vampires use this as coercion: submit to being a thrall or die. Others genuinely offer partnership within these constraints. The law makes genuine equality impossible in mixed relationships.'

    - intimate_partner_exception
    - binding_requirement_after_revelation
    - coercion_potential
    - equality_impossible
    - truth_as_weapon
    significance: 'Masquerade Law means every vampire-human romance contains inherent coercion: "Be mine forever or die" isn''t really a choice. Even well-meaning vampires participate in this system.'
    mechanics: 'Masquerade violations investigated by local vampire councils. Penalties range from warning (minor slip, no human noticed) to execution (deliberate revelation, recorded evidence, multiple witnesses). Common enforcement: eliminate all witnesses, destroy all evidence, kill the violating vampire if necessary. Vampires who create too many bodies or attract hunter attention even without direct violation also face punishment. Councils employ specialists in evidence elimination, memory alteration, and witness management.'
    erotic_implications: 'The Masquerade paradox: vampires must hide their nature from potential partners until intimacy makes hiding difficult. Some vampires only feed from anonymous victims to avoid complications. Others cultivate long-term human partners, slowly revealing truth and simultaneously deepening bond/dependence so the human won''t flee. The most controlling use Masquerade as excuse to eliminate partners who try to leave—"you know too much" becomes pretext for murder. The law enables predatory relationship dynamics while providing cover: "I have to do this for my safety."'
