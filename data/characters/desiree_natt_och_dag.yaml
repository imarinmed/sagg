  psychological_profile: Desirée maintains perfect facade while suppressing genuine
    desires. Her marriage to Henry is political alliance; her attraction to Jacques
    represents everything she denies herself. Views daughter as extension of image.
  power_dynamics: Social dominant who controls through reputation and image. Submissive
    in private to patriarchal structures she publicly maintains.
