1
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,120
Your friend is doing
as well as can be expected.

2
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,200
He needs to sober up
and get a tetanus shot.

3
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,920
But if the bite
had been a little higher on the neck,

4
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:11,640
we would have had
a completely different situation.

5
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,800
This could have gotten a lot worse.

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,480
–Okay. Thanks.
–I’m out. Call if anything.

7
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:21,680
Alfred, wait!

8
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:30,480
–Talk later.
–Come on now, guys!

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:35,440
There’s both alcohol and minors
inside your premises, and cold-bloods.

10
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,760
–Of course you bear the responsibility.
–It’s just a party.

11
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,560
We can’t take responsibility
for what everyone else does.

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,920
Haven’t we had
this conversation before?

13
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:46,600
Yeah, that’s exactly the point.

14
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,880
I don’t want any more shit
from either of you. Is that understood?

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,040
–Mm…
–Yes.

16
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,800
Cause we are young,
wild, we are free

17
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,560
BST!

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,800
It's just the way
that it's supposed to be

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,880
BST!

20
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,000
What the fuck…

21
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:40,000
Vampires can fucking go to hell!
And you can’t trust them.

22
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,000
And vamp is just as dangerous
as vampires. Shut up!

23
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,640
–She was fucking about to bite Eric to death.
–What the hell, Alfred…

24
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:54,840
Kiara, who I thought I was in love with,
you can’t trust her.

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,800
All she cares about
is status and dancing.

26
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,880
Who the fuck cares about dancing?
It’s so fucking lame.

27
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,720
Batgirls can go to hell.

28
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,440
I’m logging out.

29
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,320
Look! Have you seen the video of Alfred?

30
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:15,840
–Yeah, the whole team is talking about it.
–Send it to me.

31
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,880
–Oh my god!
–What?

32
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,680
–Yeah, but look!
–What then?

33
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,680
Look, what an idiot!

34
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:26,320
What a fucking loser.

35
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,040
–I mean, it’s completely insane.
–Yeah, it’s completely insane.

36
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,880
–But what are you talking about?
–Yeah, United beat Liverpool.

37
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,920
Come on,
that’s not what I mean.

38
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:48,400
Yes… We’ve spoken to the police
and we’ve spoken to the principal.

39
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,720
You’ve lied to us, you’ve stolen

40
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,280
and you’ve blamed it
on your brother.

41
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,800
You got triggered and bit a human.

42
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,800
But what’s worse,
you’ve brought shame on our name.

43
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:04,040
We won’t be invited
to the Blood-fest in Frankfurt next year.

44
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,320
And the dance!

45
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:08,240
You’ve broken vampire honor.

46
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,120
I’m nominated for Vampire of the Year.
Am I supposed to stand on stage,

47
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,120
when my own daughter breaks
all vampire laws and rules?

48
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:17,400
Do you understand how serious this is?

49
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:21,200
Look at me when I’m talking to you!
You’ve risked everything.

50
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,720
Not just for us,
but for all vampires.

51
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
The Blood System
is going to file a child welfare report.

52
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,840
Here’s what we’re doing now.

53
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
No more hanging out with humans,
especially no more dancing.

54
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,960
Straight home to and from school.

55
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,760
–So I can keep going to school?
–We’ll see.

56
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,360
The principal will decide tonight.

57
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,880
That’s all. You can go.

58
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,760
My parents were mega pissed.
Worst interrogation all damn morning.

59
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,520
–I had Elise on the hook, you know.
–What happened then?

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
I accidentally called her the wrong name.

61
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,840
I called her Elsa
instead of Elise. She just left.

62
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,280
–Did you see what the C girl was wearing?
–Yeah.

63
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:01,720
–What?
–What? No.

64
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:03,160
No, thought so.

65
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:06,640
Will Eric turn
into a vampire because he got bitten?

66
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:10,840
No, you’ve watched
way too many movies.

67
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:17,840
Come to this year’s big event: the masquerade.
Don’t forget to sign up today.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,520
Or don’t. I don’t care.

69
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:26,440
No, damn it! Elise, sorry!

70
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,480
Typical! So fucking typical of me!

71
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,240
–Eric…
–Yeah.

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,000
Can you come with me
to my office for a moment?

73
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,640
Yeah, of course.

74
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,360
–So, how much anxiety do you have?
–What?

75
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:42,760
I would have fled the country if I were you.

76
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,440
First your best friend makes out
with your girl.

77
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
She’s not my girl.

78
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,600
Then the drunk clip
of your vampire romance spreads all over school.

79
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,360
Or maybe even
the whole municipality.

80
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,480
–Thanks, that really warms my heart.
–Can’t you even sleep with a vampire?

81
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:58,560
–Do you even know what “sleep with” means?
–I’m just asking. Want some?

82
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:00,800
But what happens to the balls
if you sleep with a cold-blood?

83
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
They get completely cold,
like when you swim in cold water?

84
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,280
If you swam in cold water

85
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,600
your dick would shrink
to the size of a butterfly larva,

86
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,120
and then it flies away like a butterfly.

87
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,920
It’s all about technique.

88
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:17,600
Hello? Is there anyone here who wants
vampires to be allowed at the masquerade?

89
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:21,320
No, no one wants to see
a single vampire for the rest of the year.

90
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,600
Oh, is he a little grumpy?

91
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:28,000
That’s right, Alfred.
Cute clip. Really sassy.

92
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,000
Ew!

93
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,920
What a fucking idiot Eric is, right?

94
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:44,280
Yeah, I know. But he’s okay.

95
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:46,280
But you could have died.

96
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:48,800
A crazy
and completely fucking aggro vampire, you know.

97
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,720
Nah, I don’t know.
Maybe it wasn’t that dangerous.

98
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:55,720
But she bit Eric,
and all the parents know everything.

99
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:58,000
Dad’s going to take back
his credit card.

100
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,200
Oh, poor you, Chloe!

101
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
Yeah, but screw that now.

102
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:06,480
I’ve found a new dancer
for Batgirls: Kylie.

103
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:08,880
Kylie has several thousand followers
on TikTok now.

104
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,280
Oh, okay.
What happened to Adam or Siri?

105
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:17,840
Adam is still poor,
and the glasses worm can’t be in.

106
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,360
–What happened to Kiara then?
–Yeah, you get it. Hello!

107
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,040
Bloodsuckers absolutely cannot be in.

108
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,080
Do you see who it is?

109
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,520
–Nah… Should I know?
–Oh my god!

110
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:09,760
Today’s youth. Brain rot!

111
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:13,520
–It’s Elvis, Eric!
–Oh, okay.

112
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,040
But try
to keep up a little, Eric.

113
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,440
I’ve booked him for the masquerade.

114
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,840
I’ve done your job,
you could say.

115
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,040
All you need to do is
pay this Swish number.

116
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,720
–Got a good price, I’ll tell you.
–Okay, thanks.

117
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,520
Am I done now?

118
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,320
Shit, right!

119
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,120
–She wasn’t going to get triggered, right?
–No, it was pig blood.

120
00:08:06,280 --> 00:08:10,200
–Oh my god!
–Oops!

121
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,880
–Where’s Kiara?
–She’s not allowed anymore.

122
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,080
Don’t screw this up now, Kylie,
like the bloodsucker did.

123
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,800
A lot of people want your spot.

124
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,080
Okay, let’s go.

125
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,920
And five, six, seven, eight.

126
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,400
What are you doing?
You’re not holding your position.

127
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:03,280
Sorry, I don’t know what I was thinking.

128
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,720
The masquerade is any day now.
You need to level up.

129
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:09,080
–Yeah, okay, let’s go again.
–Okay.

130
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,960
And five, six, seven, eight.

131
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,320
Break!

132
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,120
We’ll take two seconds.

133
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:35,520
–Chloe, you’ve changed the choreography.
–No, I haven’t.

134
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,120
Okay. I’m out.

135
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:40,840
Out? Now?
The masquerade is any day now.

136
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,360
I’m quitting. I’m dropping out.

137
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:48,800
What are you all staring at?

138
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,440
What are you waiting for?
You get to take Elise’s spot now.

139
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,400
Some people are lucky today.

140
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,240
And five, six, seven, eight.

141
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,280
Nice blouse you’ve got.
Sorry for what I did.

142
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,720
I bought flowers
and milk chocolate,

143
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,280
but I forgot it. Damn it!

144
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:14,680
Sorry for behaving badly.
I’m really sorry.

145
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,320
Elise, wait. Wait.

146
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:19,360
Nice chocolate you’ve got.
I bought a blouse for you.

147
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,240
No, damn it. That came out wrong.
I didn’t mean to…

148
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,320
…shove my tongue down Kiara’s throat

149
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,120
or make me
feel completely worthless?

150
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,960
–I didn’t know…
–Didn’t know what?

151
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:30,840
That I hate red roses?

152
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,320
–I love you.
–Eric, stop.

153
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,720
Stop trying to win me back.
I can’t take it anymore.

154
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,160
Damn it! Elise, sorry!

155
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,720
Damn it!

156
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:52,880
Hell!

157
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,000
Okay, silence!

158
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,280
Thanks to everyone who could come here
on such short notice.

159
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:08,680
You know why we’re here,
so I’ll try to keep it short.

160
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,480
Okay. I also just want to remind everyone
that this is an information meeting,

161
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,160
and it’s important
that we keep a civil tone.

162
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,320
I mean, I know I’m not the only one
who thinks this,

163
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:26,800
but how can you let this happen
completely uncontrolled?

164
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,520
First of all,
it’s not completely uncontrolled.

165
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,800
We follow all procedures
and restrictions

166
00:11:32,960 --> 00:11:36,720
completely according to
all the Blood System’s recommendations.

167
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Recommendations, you say?

168
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:42,560
How fun is it
that our kids have to risk their lives

169
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,040
because someone in Stockholm decided
they should go to the same school?

170
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,680
That’s not exactly
how it is.

171
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:51,360
We all bear responsibility.

172
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:57,680
And cold-bloods are subject to the same
compulsory schooling as all humans.

173
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:00,320
But what about me?
I’ve got a worried boy at home.

174
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,480
He’s wondering what will happen
with the masquerade

175
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:08,000
that he’s been looking forward to so much.
Are vampires allowed at the ball now?

176
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,960
Can you then guarantee
our children’s safety?

177
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:29,560
I’ve come to a decision,
and it wasn’t easy, I’ll tell you.

178
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:37,120
I have decided
that vampires, cold-bloods…

179
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,120
…are not welcome
at this year’s masquerade.

180
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,920
Yes… Thank you.

181
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:24,040
Yo. Need help, or?

182
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:26,880
No, I actually think
I can make out on my own.

183
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:29,280
I don’t need your help with that.

184
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:31,280
Just a tip.
Don’t choose my girl next time.

185
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,880
Please, not you too.

186
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,240
–What do you mean not me too?
–Yeah, but you know how I am.

187
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,080
Yeah, thanks.

188
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:44,440
–Everything turned to shit.
–Everything?

189
00:14:44,600 --> 00:14:48,400
–Yeah, everything.
–With Elise, you mean, or?

190
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:53,280
Yeah, not just that,
but yeah, definitely with Elise.

191
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:00,720
–What actually happened.
–At Kiara’s party?

192
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,880
–Nothing happened.
–What do you mean nothing?

193
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,240
–Come on. You know what I mean.
–No, I don’t know what you mean.

194
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,280
Yeah, it didn’t work.

195
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,160
It? What do you mean “it”?

196
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:21,840
–You couldn’t get it up?
–Yeah, I don’t know what happened.

197
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,600
I was probably nervous or something.
I have no idea.

198
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,760
What the hell did you do then?
What did she do?

199
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:31,080
–I panicked.
–Panicked? You just bailed.

200
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,600
–Yeah, and what was I supposed to do?
–Why haven’t you said anything?

201
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,760
What was I supposed to say?

202
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,720
Hi, I’m Eric,
and I couldn’t get it up.

203
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,600
–So that’s why you dissed her.
–Yeah.

204
00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,120
She can’t figure anything out.
You really should talk to her.

205
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,720
No way!
What do you think I’m trying to do, Affe?

206
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:02,440
–But admit you’re jealous.
–Of what?

207
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,840
That I got bitten
by a vampire and you didn’t.

208
00:16:12,280 --> 00:16:16,680
–But you can’t become a vampire, right?
–If you get bitten?

209
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,640
No. It’s pretty low risk.

210
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,560
Or low chance.
Depends on how you look at it.

211
00:16:28,760 --> 00:16:32,120
–I brought one more anyway.
–Throw them straight on the fire.

212
00:16:32,280 --> 00:16:35,160
Come on! You don’t mean that.
You have to talk to her too.

213
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,040
Vampires and humans don’t belong together.

214
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
She’s seen the clip, right?

215
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:47,400
Yeah! She may be traditional,
but she’s got internet anyway.

216
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,880
Fuck that this clip
went viral.

217
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,840
You get that I didn’t make out
with Kiara on purpose, right?

218
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,360
Yeah, Elise said that.
It’s not really Kiara’s fault either.

219
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,680
But I still
made the right decision, right?

220
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:07,760
–With Kiara?
–Yeah, that I ditched her.

221
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:10,640
–We’re not hanging with her anymore.
–What?

222
00:17:10,800 --> 00:17:12,960
Who said that? Are you crazy or what?

223
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:20,040
Damn it! Damn it! Put out the fire, Eric.

224
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,000
It takes a lot of courage
for you to show up here.

225
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,120
I know I’ve messed things up.

226
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,520
I know I’ve brought shame
on your family.

227
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:21,520
Even though I learned everything
about vampire honor

228
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,160
I still made Kiara break it.

229
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,400
I’m mostly sorry
that I hurt your sister.

230
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:28,120
–I’m sorry. Is she home?
–No.

231
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,600
Where is she then?

232
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,600
Do you seriously think
I would tell you?

233
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,480
No, that’s true.
I didn’t think so.

234
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:39,960
But just so you know, none
of this is Kiara’s fault. Here.

235
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:46,480
–You know where she is.
–What did you say?

236
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,000
I said you’ve got ten seconds
before I…

237
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:04,160
–Hi.
–Hi.

238
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:09,600
I’ve been thinking a bit,
and the clip wasn’t meant to…

239
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,040
What?

240
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,240
I was sad. I’m sad.

241
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:18,120
I brought an invitation anyway.

242
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,320
–I heard what you said to Chloe.
–Said what?

243
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,840
What you said about vampires. That no one
wants to see a fucking vampire anymore.

244
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,040
No one sees me anymore.

245
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,560
What was I supposed to say?
I just wanted to get rid of her.

246
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:37,520
I was thinking anyway
that I have two invitations

247
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,120
and I know
you really want to go.

248
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:43,400
I know how much
you’ve been looking forward to dancing.

249
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:51,760
I know I’m a dork
and a nerd,

250
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:54,080
and that I’ve made a fool of myself.

251
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,720
But I’ve thought about vampires
my whole life,

252
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,120
but none of my vampire fantasies
can even come close to

253
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:01,320
what it’s like when I’m with you.

254
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,520
With you everything is real
and not fantasy.

255
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:11,200
Before you continue, I want to say
that I appreciate your honesty.

256
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,040
But I think you actually know
that we don’t belong together.

257
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:21,120
So thank you so much for the invitation,
but I have to say no.

258
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:27,280
Good decision.
I’m probably going home anyway, so…

259
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:30,880
I’m a vampire and you’re a human.

260
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,160
We have two completely different ways of living.
It’s too complicated.

261
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:36,440
I’m dangerous for you

262
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,760
and there’s a reason
we should live separately.

263
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,880
We don’t belong together.

264
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,760
Good decision.
Rules exist for a reason.

265
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,280
But not everything is just laws
and rules.

266
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:58,080
There are feelings too.
Fears, prejudices and love.

267
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,160
I know
that you as a vampire are dangerous to me,

268
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,480
but you have to think about
that you can hurt me in other ways.

269
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:06,480
You might not bite me to death
so I die,

270
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,520
but I can die of a broken heart.

271
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:25,080
Sorry.

272
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:50,120
