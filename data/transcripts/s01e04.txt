1
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:13,400
–Guys!
–Help! Help!

2
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,720
Help!

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,960
–Eric! Eric!
–What are you doing?

4
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,360
Help! Crisis-vamp!

5
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,000
Vamp! Vamp! Vamp!

6
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,320
What happened? Did she get triggered?

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:48,240
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

8
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,440
I actually thought
it was pretty cool.

9
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,040
–Too bad I didn’t get it on video.
–Thanks.

10
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:58,360
What is it?

11
00:00:58,520 --> 00:01:02,240
I’m just scared
that I won’t be allowed to dance anymore.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,840
Forget about dancing.
You can hang with us instead.

13
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:09,320
Blood and honor.

14
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,280
Cause we are young,
wild, we are free

15
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:24,000
BST!

16
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,280
It's just the way
that it's supposed to be

17
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:30,640
BST!

18
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:37,560
You’re far from home now.
You’re lost.

19
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:43,760
No, I’m not.
But maybe you are.

20
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,520
Why couldn’t we take the car?

21
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:55,440
I didn’t know it was this far.
Calm down. Here they come.

22
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,640
–Seriously!
–But don’t say anything stupid now.

23
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,440
–Which one of you two is Didde?
–That’s me.

24
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,120
Do you guys have any money then?

25
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,720
–Give me the card.
–My card? Why should we take mine?

26
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:24,120
Give me the card! Give it here!

27
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,720
Here.

28
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,960
–You think we take cards or what?
–No… Or I don’t know…

29
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,880
Of course we fucking take cards.

30
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,680
–Yeah, what’s your PIN?
–3162.

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:45,040
Sweet. You’ll get it back tomorrow.

32
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,160
How the hell do you know my PIN?

33
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:49,840
I’ve seen you type it in once.

34
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,120
We’re friends. Don’t you trust me?

35
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,680
But I don’t know yours.

36
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
–When am I getting my card back?
–Tomorrow. He said so.

37
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:15,160
How are we supposed to get this home,
were you thinking?

38
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:27,920
Have you ever thought about
how fast I solve problems?

39
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,440
You’re fucking king, Didde!
You’re fucking king, you know that?

40
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,840
–You scared me.
–I scared you?!

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
How did you get in?

42
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,520
What do you think? Through the door.
The butler let me in.

43
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:48,920
–What do you think? What’s everyone going to say?
–About what?

44
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,160
I lost control
and almost killed everyone yesterday.

45
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,520
Yeah, that’s true.
They’re probably talking a lot of shit.

46
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,840
Oh, what have I done?
I’m never going to be allowed to be in again.

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,600
They’ll soon have something new to talk about.

48
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:05,080
But maybe you should consider doing something
to improve your reputation.

49
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,800
I know! I can have a party.
Then maybe I’ll become more popular.

50
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,680
Party? You? Here?

51
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,800
–No, that’s not going to end well.
–You might be right.

52
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,640
–What are you doing?
–I’m calling Elise.

53
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:26,760
I’m a woman who is a vampire.
Red heart.

54
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,360
Hello?

55
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
–Hi!
–What are you doing?

56
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:35,000
–I just woke up.
–Oh. But how are you?

57
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,440
Yeah, I’m okay I guess. A bit tired
and stuff. And I’m dying of shame about yesterday.

58
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,280
But why?
It wasn’t your fault.

59
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,000
I thought everyone hated me.

60
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,480
No, the sauna thing was clumsy.
We should have thought of that.

61
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,440
But are you okay then?

62
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:54,600
–Hello?
–Yeah. Yeah, I’m okay.

63
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,200
How are you then? I saw
what happened between you and Eric.

64
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,560
–What? You saw?
–Yeah. I saw you got sad.

65
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,720
He left right when you were going to kiss.

66
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:07,680
Yeah, I actually don’t know
what I’m doing wrong anymore.

67
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,680
I think I know.
I can help you if you want.

68
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:13,560
Okay. But can’t you come here then?

69
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:17,320
–I promised Dad I’d change the timing belt.
–Yeah, I’m coming.

70
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,680
Okay, see you then. Bye.

71
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,360
–I’m going to Elise.
–I’m coming with you.

72
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,640
–No, you’re not.
–No.

73
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,720
–Kiara was so hot.
–Yeah, like, how much do you think that cost?

74
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,000
Did you see Kiara this weekend?
What an ass!

75
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,320
What lights, man.

76
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:46,080
I didn’t know you
could convert a car like that into an EPA.

77
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,680
How did that happen?
Kiara suddenly became super popular.

78
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,400
Yeah, and now Alfred
is popular too.

79
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,640
Is Kiara allowed in Batgirls now?

80
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,880
It’s not just because Chloe thinks
Kiara is sassy now.

81
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:01,240
–There has to be an ulterior motive.
–Yeah, for sure.

82
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:03,920
Of course
the whole school is talking shit about you now.

83
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,920
You got triggered
and you almost killed Alfred.

84
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,920
–Yeah, but Elise said…
–Don’t worry. I’ll help you.

85
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,680
Okay…

86
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,240
I know one thing you can do
to get into Batgirls.

87
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,040
What? Tell me!

88
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,600
No, I don’t know
if I want to put this on you.

89
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,040
Come on, just say it.

90
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,000
I understand if you don’t want to,
but if I were you

91
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,240
I would have a party.

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:36,840
–Okay. Or why?
–Then everyone will like you again.

93
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:41,680
But you shouldn’t do anything
just to become popular.

94
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,560
There! Yes! Exactly like that!

95
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,080
You’re so fucking good. Oh my god!

96
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:52,400
–What the fuck? Miss the training!
–It was worth it. Smile.

97
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,280
–What the hell are you doing?
–Smart, right?

98
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,880
You can take pictures
without them spreading online.

99
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:03,400
Yeah, that’s smart.
What the hell is this then?

100
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:08,440
It’s laughing gas.

101
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,160
–What the fuck, that’s coconut!
–So what?

102
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:18,600
–I’m allergic to nuts.
–But coconut isn’t a nut, Kevin.

103
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,520
But it is! Coconut nut.

104
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:26,000
You’re such a fucking party pooper.
There’s no real coconut in it.

105
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,840
It’s additives
that make it taste like coconut.

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,240
–Hey guys!
–Yo.

107
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:34,520
You bought laughing gas?
Are you three years old or what?

108
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,160
–What?
–There’s way better stuff.

109
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,080
–Vamp for example.
–Oh.

110
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:44,280
–How do we get that then?
–Come to the party and you’ll see.

111
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:49,480
There’s no coconut in it, right?
Or…? Coconut…

112
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,840
Radio: Oh yes, today’s hits are presented
by the Blood System.

113
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:04,040
...because Alfred has a bowl cut!
Alfred is a nerd

114
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,760
It’s an iconic dance move.
Scorpion to bridge.

115
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:09,600
–She’s wearing heels too.
–That was her signature move.

116
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,200
–No one has done it since.
–Are you kidding? No one?

117
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,200
Rumor has it she was a vampire
and the founder of Batgirls.

118
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,840
Okay, but if I know the choreography,

119
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,720
is it guaranteed
that I’ll be in the final show then?

120
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,920
I think so.
But if you ask Chloe

121
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,040
she only cares about
looking hot and being popular.

122
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,440
But aren’t you the one who decides
who gets to be in?

123
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,640
Well… We decide together.

124
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,360
I try to be fair,
but Chloe is a bit more… you know.

125
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:42,480
If you just do what Chloe says,
you’ll definitely get to be in.

126
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:45,600
Okay, but let’s run the choreography again.

127
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,760
Okay, but help me now.
What should I reply to Eric?

128
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:57,000
–Just say how you feel.
–I can’t do that.

129
00:09:57,160 --> 00:10:00,280
–He never replies anyway.
–You’re so unclear.

130
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,160
He doesn’t get it.

131
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,800
Affe, I think Elise is mad again.

132
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,520
Hello!

133
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:19,280
–Right in the middle of a match!
–Jump in. I need help.

134
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
Help me.
I don’t know what to reply.

135
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:27,040
What should I say?
How many girls have I had?

136
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,360
You’ve been texting Anna Book’s daughter.
You always have something to say.

137
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,320
Elise is impossible to understand.

138
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,280
It feels
like I’ve done something again.

139
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,640
Please help me.

140
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,360
I go from being your best friend,
to the nerd you hang out with

141
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,360
to being
some fucking relationship coach.

142
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:44,440
Yeah, exactly like that. Help me!

143
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,160
Shit! It’s enough that I touch
the phone and she’s already going.

144
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,640
“I want to be with you.”

145
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:53,640
Now I sent it.
He’s not going to reply anyway.

146
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:57,760
Completely insane! It’s the first time
Elise has written something I actually understand.

147
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:00,360
–I don’t need to reply to that.
–No.

148
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:03,040
Sometimes women
want men who take charge.

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,880
Watch and learn.

150
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,680
What the hell do we do now?

151
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,920
Zoom in! Zoom in!

152
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:34,880
–What the hell…
–Calm down Eric, I’ve got this.

153
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:40,920
–She’s writing again.
–“What are you wearing?”

154
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,680
–What? No. No, Alfred.
–Yes.

155
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,520
–Absolutely not.
–Cowboy hat now.

156
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:09,760
Watch and learn.

157
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:13,560
“Continuing at Kiara’s party.”
What happens?

158
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,640
If nothing else happens
I’m thinking of playing now.

159
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,000
–Crazy that Kiara is having a party.
–Super crazy.

160
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,360
Yeah, it’s crazy.

161
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:25,440
–Kiara? Kiara is having a party?
–Yes.

162
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:30,000
–Who the hell tricked her into that?
–No idea.

163
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:34,400
Shit! It looks like asthma medicine
for bats.

164
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,880
It’s bats, not fladdermöss.

165
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,120
Stop being such a nerd, Kevin.
Bending words and stuff.

166
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,520
How do you do it then?

167
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:42,720
It’s anti-trigger medicine
for vampires.

168
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,040
–But you get the world’s biggest high.
–Like laughing gas, kind of.

169
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,320
–It’s not dangerous, right?
–Who cares if you get a high.

170
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,960
You’ll understand when you feel it.

171
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,400
All impressions
become a hundred times bigger.

172
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:56,080
–It’s like an orgasm for the brain.
–Nice!

173
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,680
You get one if you get more.

174
00:12:57,840 --> 00:13:01,000
Okay, and where
is that fucking party then?

175
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,800
Okay, we need to set the table,
get snacks, good music and drinks.

176
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:10,080
Calm, calm, calm. Breathe.

177
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,160
We start with the most important: drinks.
My cousin Kalle Blyfot solves that.

178
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,680
–No, we don’t need that.
–No?

179
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:17,400
We’ve got it here.

180
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,880
–What do you mean here?
–Yeah, here.

181
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:26,120
–You’re joking.
–Come on, let’s go down.

182
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,040
–No, no, we can’t go down there.
–Yes we can.

183
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,840
–Shit, how cool this is.
–You can take the lamp.

184
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,680
–What? Can you see in the dark?
–Yeah, I’m a vampire.

185
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:46,200
–Stop staring at me like that.
–Right. I forgot about that.

186
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:51,200
–Wait for me. It’s fucking creepy.
–Coward!

187
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:56,880
Holy shit! I was thinking maybe cider,
but witch brew absolutely works.

188
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,840
Now tell me why you like vampires.

189
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:03,200
–When I can’t run away, you mean?
–Yes. And be serious now.

190
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:06,920
–Stop, look at me.
–Sorry.

191
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:10,560
–I can’t be bothered to tell the whole story.
–Come on.

192
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:17,720
Okay then. It was winter.
Me and Mom were on our way to Grandma.

193
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,280
Suddenly the car skidded
and we ended up in the ditch.

194
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,280
Wow! What happened?

195
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:27,760
I barely remember.
There was just blood everywhere.

196
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,760
I thought I was going to die.

197
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:32,000
Then suddenly
a vampire came into the car.

198
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,520
But somehow it felt
like he wanted to help me.

199
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:39,120
–Did he get triggered?
–No.

200
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:43,840
He just saved me somehow.
Then the ambulance arrived.

201
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,760
Damn!

202
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:48,240
–You swear?
–Yeah. You guys swear.

203
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:51,280
I don’t fucking swear. Eric swears.

204
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,880
What kind of place is this?

205
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,080
An old sacrificial place
and a secret escape route

206
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,520
from the time before humans
and vampires made peace.

207
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:04,240
–What? Before the blood pact and everything?
–Yeah, long before that.

208
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Back when vampires ate humans

209
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:09,680
and humans
staked vampires to death.

210
00:15:09,840 --> 00:15:11,960
–Now it’s your turn.
–What?

211
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:15,280
–To tell something personal.
–What?

212
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,920
–Why your brother is so fucking creepy.
–Long story.

213
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:22,640
But he’s pissed because I’m going
to inherit our family’s assets.

214
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:26,200
Because we vampires are matriarchal.

215
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:29,080
The youngest daughter inherits everything,
including name and title.

216
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:32,080
So when you get married your husband
has to change his name to Natt and Dag.

217
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,480
–Correct.
–And the money?

218
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,360
Everything.

219
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,640
Yeah, then you can understand
why he’s a bit crooked.

220
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,040
Though he has a long time
to save up.

221
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,480
Yeah, like 200 years.

222
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:48,760
–But something happened too.
–What?

223
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:51,120
Yeah, when he started high school.

224
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:53,840
It almost ended badly
with a girl.

225
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,720
That’s why you’re not allowed to hang out
with humans.

226
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,600
I am allowed to hang out with humans.

227
00:15:57,760 --> 00:16:01,880
I mean hang out, really hang out with humans.
Human guys.

228
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,440
Oh! They’re probably afraid
I’ll fall in love with a human.

229
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
Is it that dangerous?

230
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:17,080
Is it true that vampires cry
if they love someone?

231
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,600
Yes.

232
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,720
So you would have cried
if you were in love with someone?

233
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:29,880
The party! Hello! We have to hurry.

234
00:16:36,760 --> 00:16:40,680
–What the hell! Is it good?
–Yeah, it’s good. You?

235
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:44,360
–Here. So cool that you came!
–It’s so fucking cool.

236
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,040
–Pleasure!
–The snacks should be enough for everyone.

237
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,120
Yeah, no problem.

238
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,440
Hi!

239
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,040
–Hi!
–Hi!

240
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:04,160
–Hey, do you know if Chloe is coming?
–No. Why?

241
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:07,480
No, I mean it would have been fun
if she was here.

242
00:17:10,920 --> 00:17:14,720
Go to Eric now. He’s sitting there.
Tell him you want him.

243
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,800
–I can’t do that.
–Yes, go there now.

244
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,280
Tell him he looks hot tonight.

245
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:24,360
–You can’t trust your gut feeling.
–Yes you can.

246
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,120
Hi.

247
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:29,120
–Hi!
–You look so hot tonight!

248
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,720
–That was so cute what you wrote earlier.
–Then we have something in common.

249
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:37,920
–Is it good?
–Yeah, it’s good.

250
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,800
–Hi!
–Hi.

251
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,560
–You don’t think the rumor will spread?
–About what?

252
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,960
That I’m having a party,
and uninvited guests show up.

253
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,640
No, you live in the middle of nowhere.

254
00:17:51,800 --> 00:17:54,760
How do you even get here?
Subway or what?

255
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:58,760
Kevin and Didde in the fucking house!

256
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Hi Kiara! I brought some friends.

257
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,920
–Yo, gay boys!
–Is this the national pocket ping-pong team?

258
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,800
Wait, I’ll help you.
There! Kiss each other now.

259
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:20,240
What the hell?

260
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,160
It’s finished.
I’m going to look for more.

261
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:44,960
Bingo!

262
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:53,040
Can everyone listen up for a second?
Now we fucking go!

263
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:44,960
There we go!

264
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,680
It’s really loud in here.

265
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,760
–Should we go somewhere else?
–What?

266
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:02,560
–Somewhere else.
–Come on, let’s go dance.

267
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,960
Draw a razor blade.

268
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,200
–Should we…?
–What?

269
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,520
–Should we…?
–Okay.

270
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,480
