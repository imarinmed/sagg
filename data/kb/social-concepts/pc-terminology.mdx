      In the canonical timeline, "cold-blooded" serves as the preferred PC (politically correct) terminology for vampires in integrated human-vampire societies, particularly at Skaraborg High. The term reflects a cultural shift toward respectful coexistence and inclusive language practices.
      
      In **s01e01**, the integration narrative establishes that vampires and humans coexist at Skaraborg High with explicit social protocols. The introduction of "cold-blooded" as euphemistic terminology demonstrates the school's commitment to creating a language framework that acknowledges vampire nature without resorting to historical slurs. This linguistic choice parallels real-world movements toward inclusive language that recognize marginalized groups' preferences for self-identification.
      
      In **s01e02**, the terminology debate continues as characters navigate the practical implications of this linguistic integration. "Cold-blooded" becomes a linguistic marker of the society's attempt to transcend historical antagonism between species. The term's adoption among younger generations signals successful normalization of vampire-human relationships in institutional settings. However, the existence of the debate itself—that some still prefer "vampire" over "cold-blooded"—suggests the PC terminology represents an ongoing negotiation rather than universal acceptance.
      
      The terminology reflects broader social integration efforts: just as schools adopted anti-bullying policies and diversity curricula, the adoption of "cold-blooded" represents institutional acknowledgment of vampire personhood and dignity. The very existence of preferred terminology indicates that vampires have achieved sufficient social status to influence language norms in their institutional spaces.

      In the dark adaptation, the "cold-blooded vs vampire" terminology debate becomes a focal point for examining linguistic control, historical erasure, and power dynamics within vampire-human integration. What appears as progressive inclusivity masks deeper mechanisms of oppression and identity suppression.
      
      **Euphemism as Erasure**: The term "cold-blooded" functions as enforced historical amnesia. By replacing "vampire"—a term laden with predatory history, sexual danger, and transgressive power—"cold-blooded" sanitizes vampire nature into biological neutrality. Vampires are forced to accept terminology that denies their predatory essence, their capacity for violence, their erotic transgression. The institutional mandate to use "cold-blooded" becomes a form of linguistic domestication, rendering vampires safe, manageable, non-threatening. Those who continue to use "vampire" face social sanctions, redefined as ignorant, bigoted, or dangerous.
      
      **Power to Name as Power to Control**: Language policing becomes an instrument of vampire subjugation. Humans—the politically dominant species—dictate which terms are "acceptable," forcing vampires to accept language that obscures their nature. This echoes historical patterns where colonizers renamed indigenous peoples, enslaved populations were forbidden their native languages, and marginalized groups were forced to accept dehumanizing terminology. In the dark adaptation, the direction is inverted: vampires, despite their predatory superiority, are linguistically disempowered, forced to accept human-mandated self-identification.
      
      **Generational Conflict and Memory Control**: Older vampires remember a time when "vampire" carried fearful power. Younger vampires, socialized at Skaraborg High, internalize "cold-blooded" as their identity, losing connection to their predatory heritage and the transgressive power their ancestors wielded. The adoption of "cold-blooded" becomes a form of cultural genocide—each generation further removed from authentic vampire identity. Language functions as a tool for temporal control, severing younger vampires from historical memory and ancestral power.
      
      **Reclamation and Resistance**: Characters who insist on "vampire" engage in linguistic reclamation, refusing the sanitized identity forced upon them. Using "vampire" becomes an act of defiance, a claim to predatory nature, erotic transgression, and dangerous otherness. In D/s dynamics between vampire and human partners, the choice of terminology—who can say "vampire," who must say "cold-blooded"—becomes a marker of dominance and submission. A dominant vampire character might demand lovers address them as "vampire" rather than accept the neutered "cold-blooded." Conversely, human dominants might enforce "cold-blooded" as a linguistic humiliation, a constant reminder that even the vampire's self-identification is subject to human control.
      
      **Institutional Enforcement and Social Policing**: Skaraborg High's adoption of "cold-blooded" represents institutional violence disguised as progress. Students face social ostracism, administrative discipline, or worse for using "vampire." Teachers police language with the zeal of ideological enforcers. The "inclusive" terminology becomes a compliance mechanism, a test of submission to human-mandated norms. Vampires learn that institutional belonging requires linguistic self-erasure.
      
      The PC terminology debate becomes a microcosm of vampire-human power relations: despite their predatory superiority and erotic danger, vampires are linguistically disempowered, forced into identities that deny their essential nature, their history, their transgressive capacity. The "progress" of inclusive language masks systemic erasure of vampire identity itself.

      - Reclaiming "vampire" as erotic transgression, dangerous arousal
      - Power exchange through terminology control in intimate relationships
      - Forbidden use of "vampire" as intimate transgression, linguistic submission
      - Generational erotics of resistance vs compliance
    taboo_potential:
      - Forced linguistic assimilation parallels cultural genocide
      - Language policing as institutional violence
      - Memory erasure through generational language shift
      - Identity suppression through "progressive" terminology
      - Parallels to real-world language policing and cultural erasure debates

## Overview

The terminology debate surrounding "cold-blooded" versus "vampire" represents a linguistic and political fault line in vampire-human integrated societies. What appears as straightforward progressive language reform masks deeper questions about power, identity, historical memory, and institutional control.

## BST Context

In the canonical timeline, "cold-blooded" serves as institutional shorthand for respectful vampire-human coexistence. Skaraborg High's adoption of this terminology in its official documents and peer culture reflects a genuine cultural shift toward inclusive language practices, paralleling real-world movements toward anti-discriminatory terminology.

## SST Implications

In the dark adaptation, the terminology debate becomes a lens for examining how linguistic control functions as a mechanism of power. The enforcement of "cold-blooded" against "vampire" reveals how institutions use language policing to suppress transgressive identities and erase historical memory. For vampire characters navigating Skaraborg High, every linguistic choice becomes a statement about submission or resistance, compliance or transgression.
