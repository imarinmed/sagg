# Natt och Dag Estate

## Summary

The ancient and imposing residence of the Natt och Dag vampire lineage. It is both a sanctuary for the family and a repository of their dark secrets and historical relics.

## BST

### Description
The estate has been the family's seat for centuries. It is where Alfred is invited for lunch, an event that turns into a nightmare when Kiara is triggered. The house is filled with relics, most notably the stake that killed Count Dracula. The cellar is particularly significant, containing evidence of the family's pre-peace era activities, including sacrificial sites and escape tunnels.

### Source Episodes
- s01e03: Alfred visits for lunch; the stake is revealed.
- s01e04: Kiara hosts a party here; the cellar and its secrets are explored.

## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation emphasizes the estate's role as a site of "Level 3 - Horror" and "Level 5 - Taboo." The lunch ritual is transformed into a mandatory family feeding, and the party in the estate becomes a scene of human vulnerability and vampire arousal. The estate's architecture, with its hidden passages, mirrors the psychological complexity and secrets of the Natt och Dag family.
