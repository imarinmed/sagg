## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation portrays Skaraborg High as a place of psychological warfare. The "diversity" auditions for the Batgirls are seen as a forced integration that breeds resentment. The school's obsession with trophies is a metaphor for the commodification of success in a society built on blood and sweat.
