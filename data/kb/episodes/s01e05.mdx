### Dark Adaptation
The episode explores the "Level 2 - Emotional" trauma of the characters. Elise's jealousy is shown to be rooted in her own insecurities and the pressure of the school's social hierarchy. Kiara's struggle with triggering is a metaphor for her struggle to maintain her humanity in a world that sees her as a predator.
