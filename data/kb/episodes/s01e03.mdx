    description: "The lunch is transformed into a ritualized feeding session where Kiara is forced to participate. The atmosphere is one of 'Level 3 - Horror.' Kiara's attack on Eric in the sauna is explicitly depicted as a loss of control, a 'Level 4 - Erotic' moment where bloodlust and physical attraction collide."
    divergences:
    - The lunch is a dark ritual rather than an awkward meal
    - The sauna attack is more violent and sexually charged

### Dark Adaptation
This episode marks a significant shift into "Level 4 - Erotic" and "Level 5 - Taboo" content. The family lunch is a display of patriarchal power by Henry, and Kiara's attack on Eric is a moment of both violation and awakening. The physical vulnerability of the human characters is emphasized.
