## SST

### Dark Adaptation
The episode focuses on the "Level 5 - Taboo" and "Level 6 - Transgressive" aspects of the vampire-human relationship. The "Blood System" is shown to be an instrument of control, and the shame Kiara feels is tied to her family's ancient and violent traditions. The hospital scenes with Eric emphasize the physical cost of vampire intimacy.
