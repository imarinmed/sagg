## SST

### Dark Adaptation
The episode focuses on the "Level 5 - Taboo" elements of the Natt och Dag family. The cellar is used for a dark ritual during the party, and the human students' use of "Vamp" is shown to be a form of self-destruction. Kiara's role as the future matriarch is a source of both power and intense psychological pressure.
