    description: "Eric's speech is depicted as a moment of 'Level 1 - Psychological' manipulation, using the language of inclusion to maintain his own social status. Kiara's return to the masquerade is not a triumph of integration, but a step toward her embracing her dark nature. Elise's fight with the thugs is more brutal and visceral."
    divergences:
    - Eric's speech is more self-serving
    - Elise's fight is more violent and shows her own dark potential
