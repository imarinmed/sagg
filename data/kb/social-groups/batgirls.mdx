Membership is highly sought after, and the group's costumes are notoriously expensive (11,000 kr + VAT). The Principal ordered open auditions to increase diversity, leading to Kiara's inclusion."

    description: "In the dark adaptation, the Batgirls represent the social elite and the performative nature of human-vampire integration. The 'good' and 'evil' split is a metaphor for the moral ambiguity of the student body. The group's high entry cost and exclusivity highlight the class divide in Skaraborg."
    divergences:
    - More intense factional rivalry

### Description
The dark adaptation explores the Batgirls as a site of psychological bullying and social engineering. The rivalry between Elise and Chloe is more vicious, involving manipulation and the use of social status as a weapon. Kiara's presence in the group is seen as a threat to the established human order, and her integration is met with both fascination and hostility. The group's performances are ritualistic displays of beauty and power.
