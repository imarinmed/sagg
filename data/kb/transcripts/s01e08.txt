1
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:14,880
Oh, Kiara! Kiara! Kiara!

2
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:21,440
Do you take the bat Kiara
and love her in sickness and in health?

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
I hereby declare you wife
and pet.

4
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,600
Kiara! Kiara!

5
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,480
You may kiss the bat.

6
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,320
Kiara? Kiara, is that you?

7
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,640
No!

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,280
Good morning!
Looks like it was a cozy dream.

9
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,000
Mm, super cozy.

10
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,480
–Old man, this came for you today.
–Mhm?

11
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:56,600
It’s a really nice envelope.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:59,760
–Who do you think it’s from?
–Probably Eric and them.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,480
It’s too nice
to be from Eric, right?

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,920
Screw the pie, Mom.

15
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,280
B.S.T.

16
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:21,800
I mean, I didn’t mean
to invite myself.

17
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,480
You mean when you called and asked
to come here for lunch?

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,360
Exactly. I didn’t think it would happen
so fast, but of course I’m coming.

19
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,080
You can say no if you want.

20
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,800
We barely know each other
and my family is a bit… special.

21
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,280
Of course not. It’s so cool.

22
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,360
I’ve never been
to a vampire castle before.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,880
Okay. Welcome to Natt and Dag.
Blood and honor.

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,720
Yes! Yes!

25
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:52,760
How nice that we get
your first human friend over for dinner.

26
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,120
Yo, Mom!

27
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:08,240
–What the hell are you wearing?
–Looks good, right?

28
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,200
Looks good? It was ugly
even for you.

29
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,040
Where are you going?
World Championship of weird jackets or what?

30
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,440
Yo, channel. Going to a dinner.
Lunch at the Natt and Dag family.

31
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,960
–Stop filming, Affe.
–Here’s my driver who’s super pissed.

32
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,240
But come on, I don’t get it.

33
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,000
–Why am I here?
–You’re my driver.

34
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,720
We need to roll up
with some class and style.

35
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,640
–Come on now.
–Damn it!

36
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,720
You’re completely fucking unbelievable, Affe.

37
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:39,040
Do I really have to come
and open your damn door?

38
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,880
–Film now.
–Yeah, I guess I’ll film then.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,200
Hurry up, damn it!
You’re supposed to be the mascot at the match later.

40
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,640
–Mascot?
–Come on, it’s a match!

41
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,240
–And then party after.
–What party?

42
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,080
The village hall party
you’re supposed to come to.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,400
I probably can’t tonight,
and I’m probably not invited.

44
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,440
But come on… Elise is going.

45
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:03,240
–So I’m your wingman?
–No, that might be a bit much.

46
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,440
Hurry up now.
I’m not waiting more than 30 minutes.

47
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,600
–40.
–No. 35.

48
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,600
–37.5.
–Hurry the hell up!

49
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,560
Hi.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,400
Welcome. Come in.

51
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:28,800
–Nice house.
–Thanks.

52
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:31,200
Nice… suit.

53
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,560
And here’s my family.

54
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:42,880
–What a fucking wilf.
–Wilf?

55
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,800
–What is it?
–Nothing. Nothing.

56
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:52,200
My family has lived here since 1327.

57
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,400
And here’s my dance hall.

58
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,120
Wow! Is that who I think it is?

59
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,320
I don’t know who you think it is,
but it’s my grandmother.

60
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
Is Countess Dracula your grandmother?

61
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:13,160
Yes, or she was the brains
behind Count Dracula.

62
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,720
Didn’t Dracula
have, like, three brides or something?

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:20,000
Yes. That’s why
she killed him… with that.

64
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,680
You mean that…?

65
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,160
Yes, it’s the stake,
the stake that killed Count Dracula.

66
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:42,480
I’ve heard
that you like tacos, Alfred.

67
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:46,120
–I eat them every Friday.
–Mm…

68
00:04:46,280 --> 00:04:48,640
Interesting.
Just let us know if anything’s missing.

69
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:51,400
Yes, we want to show appreciation
for your human culture,

70
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,880
and serve something
you like. Taccos.

71
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,240
–Tacos.
–Tacos.

72
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,920
I could have gone for banana.

73
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,600
Enough with the banana.

74
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,160
Yes, Alfred, you’ll take good care
of our daughter, I understand.

75
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,200
Absolutely. I show her around
everywhere at school and stuff.

76
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,280
And we’re going to a party later.

77
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,840
Study party.

78
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,760
Reading and studying and stuff.

79
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:27,240
Kiara is so happy
to have met a human friend.

80
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,120
–And you seem so open-minded.
–And fearless.

81
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,720
Yeah, I like vampires.

82
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,480
Sorry. Cold-bloods.

83
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,480
It’s fine to say vampires.

84
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,000
We’re proud to
be called vampires.

85
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:51,800
It’s humans who came up
with that nonsense about cold-bloods.

86
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,920
Well, here at the Natt and Dag family
we usually entertain our guests.

87
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,760
Kiara, maybe you could dance
for our guest?

88
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:03,920
But Mom!

89
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:06,360
Do you have a favorite piece, young man?

90
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,640
Absolutely. “Crazy Frog”.

91
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:14,120
Oh, interesting choice.
We should be able to arrange that.

92
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,200
Enough with the “Crazy Frog”.

93
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,280
Ah!

94
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,080
That went well.

95
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,400
Jack…

96
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,600
Alfred, run!

97
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:23,320
–Go, Eric! Drive! Go! Go!
–What the hell are you doing?

98
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,920
Drive!

99
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:32,800
Batgirls is the dance school’s elite group,

100
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,280
and this year it’s you
who are the school’s pride.

101
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
Super good job!

102
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:45,960
These are Batgirls’ competition costumes.
We wear them with pride.

103
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:49,360
Not just anyone
can be a Batgirl.

104
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,520
We’ve never had a guy in Batgirls before,

105
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,720
so we don’t have any guy clothes.

106
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,000
–Too bad for you.
–But we’ll figure it out, of course.

107
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:02,800
With what money then
were you thinking, or?

108
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,520
Don’t worry about it anymore.

109
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,920
It went fine.
I barely had to sew anything.

110
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,560
Probably no one
will even notice.

111
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,960
But I’m embarrassed about my parents.

112
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:13,200
No, don’t be.
It was so cool.

113
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,200
It was super embarrassing.

114
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,520
Are you sure
no one is talking about it?

115
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,360
Yes.

116
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,480
I told you.
Vampires are deadly.

117
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,520
You’re exaggerating. It was an accident.

118
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,960
Are you kidding? Twice in a row!

119
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,400
First she ate everyone
at the whole dance school.

120
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,160
–Then she ate Alfred for dinner.
–It was lunch.

121
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,600
Alfred comes running
completely stressed out.

122
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,760
His whole hand was bloody.

123
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:40,560
I didn’t know what to do.
So I’m going to go with that too.

124
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:44,360
I mean, Eric just skidded off
at 120 kilometers per hour.

125
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:48,000
Alfred filmed everything! Everything!
And Dracula’s killer was there too.

126
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,280
Is it on YouTube?

127
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,120
–TikTok.
–And Snap.

128
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,600
You promise it’s only Eric
who knows about it.

129
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,520
Promise.

130
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,040
Or yeah, I might have accidentally told
someone else. Just one.

131
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,480
–But is it true?
–Yes!

132
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,800
I was at lunch at the family’s,
and the brother was completely crazy.

133
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,640
What did you eat then?

134
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:07,800
Tacos.

135
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:11,360
–Then the butler played “Crazy Frog”.
–I heard it! On a cello.

136
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,120
It’s violin.

137
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,080
–Didn’t you have to sew anything?
–Three stitches.

138
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:20,520
At least three days without anesthesia.

139
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:23,440
–Was it hard or soft tortilla?
–Soft.

140
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,800
This party I’m going to…

141
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:28,600
–I’ve never been to a party before.
–The village hall party.

142
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:31,400
–Hello, there’s a party tonight.
–What if she comes.

143
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,880
–Ew! How do we get there?
–I can drive.

144
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,480
No, we’re skipping it.

145
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,760
It’s only Eric who wants to go
and hang out with Elise.

146
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:42,200
–I want to go.
–What? Why?

147
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,840
But maybe I’m not welcome
after everything that’s happened.

148
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,920
Sure you are. They’ve already forgotten.

149
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,800
The bloodsucker Kiara
isn’t welcome anyway.

150
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:54,880
Everyone’s going. It’s going to be so fun.

151
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:57,760
Yeah, but village hall parties
are so lame.

152
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:59,760
–Yeah.
–Yeah, I agree.

153
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:03,760
–But we’re going, right?
–Of course we are.

154
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,520
Adam, I have bad news.

155
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:09,640
You need to pay
for your competition costume yourself.

156
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:12,400
–How much does it cost then?
–It’s not that expensive.

157
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:15,840
–Maybe 11,000.
–Excl. VAT.

158
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,840
–But I don’t have 11,000.
–Pookie…

159
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,800
It’s not your fault
that you’re so poor.

160
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,840
We’ll find someone else.

161
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:29,560
What are you studying? I baked.

162
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,480
Ugh! Damn, I’m driving.

163
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,200
Damn, are you here too? Hi!

164
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:40,640
–What…? Are you studying, or?
–Yeah, what does it look like?

165
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,560
Shh! We speak in small letters
in this house.

166
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,720
–Did you want something, or?
–No, no.

167
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,040
Or yeah, I have something for you.

168
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:58,080
I actually baked.
Lactose-free, of course. I’m sorry.

169
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,080
Oh… Sorry, pastries,
they’re not allowed in here.

170
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,240
No.

171
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:08,160
–Keep them in the bag.
–Yeah.

172
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,200
–For what?
–For saying we weren’t together.

173
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,640
And the other thing too, of course.

174
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:16,240
–Sorry.
–Yeah, but it’ll probably be fine.

175
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,080
–I have to go now.
–See you at the village hall party, right?

176
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:21,800
–Mm. It’ll be fun.
–Yeah.

177
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,600
By the way, it’s Chloe who’s lactose.
I’m gluten.

178
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,000
Damn!

179
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:34,280
–That wasn’t awkward at all.
–No.

180
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:38,280
I want to warn you
there might be a dance circle later.

181
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:43,040
–A dance circle. What’s that?
–You don’t know what a dance circle is?

182
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,800
Okay, it’s about
there being a big circle

183
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:49,360
and then people go in two by two.
Do you get what I mean?

184
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,600
I can’t take any more. You can go.

185
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:55,120
But I don’t know
what to wear tonight.

186
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,000
You have to wear a dress and high heels.

187
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,040
–Do they? But I thought that…
–Yup. You need rhinestones too.

188
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:06,000
Or slits or whatever it’s called.
Gala attire, luxury, lipstick.

189
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,480
That’s standard at village hall parties.

190
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:11,720
A-brunn!

191
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,760
What is that?

192
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:17,320
If you touch an A-brunn
you get anal sex or bad luck?

193
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,680
–It’s a bit unclear.
–What?

194
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,760
It’s kind of like God wants. Come on.

195
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:31,200
I’m so nervous about the party.

196
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,600
Good thing I have you
who knows what’s up.

197
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:36,440
Otherwise I would have shown up
in jeans and a top.

198
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:37,760
That’s what friends are for.

199
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,200
And by the way,
don’t worry about the haters.

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:43,680
I’m trying, but sometimes I wish
I wasn’t a vampire.

201
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,560
Don’t say that!

202
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,120
It’s so cool to be a vampire,
and a little scary.

203
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,160
See you later!

204
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,160
Gross!

205
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,680
So mature of Elise to forgive Eric,
despite everything. So big of her.

206
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:30,200
Yeah, they’re so cute together.

207
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,960
I mean, so embarrassing.

208
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,880
–Why is she taking him back?
–Can’t they just give up sometime?

209
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,120
Can’t even look. So cringe.

210
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,320
Come on, Affe. Pull yourself together.

211
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:01,440
She might think she’s not invited
because she’s a cold-blood.

212
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:03,360
Yeah, you’re probably right.

213
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:06,160
She doesn’t really like
that much attention anyway.

214
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:42,240
–Hi, Affe.
–Hi, Kiara.

215
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:46,600
What do we do now?

216
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,720
Because if you lose courage
and fall to your knees

217
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,920
you can rest here with me

218
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,080
Look at this.

219
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,440
Like a rock in the storm
to lean on

220
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:13,600
And I will never let you down

221
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:20,480
I will follow you through fire
and water, over land and sea

222
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:25,640
I will love you
until my heart stops beating

223
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,400
And we hate AIK!

224
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:34,920
From the highest mountain
to the deepest valley I will go

225
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,440
She was so hot tonight.

226
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,640
Yeah, vampires are still pretty cool.

227
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:41,960
I know.
And she’s good at dancing too.

228
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,360
Yeah, she’s better than Chloe.

229
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:48,600
I think I’ve actually changed my mind.
I like Kiara now.

230
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,680
/TOILET FLUSHING/

231
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,080
–Sounds like you have a new friend.
–And?

232
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:00,040
Maybe she can take your spot
in Batgirls.

233
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:06,720
I think Chloe is changing tactics now.

234
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,680
I will follow you through fire
and water, over land and sea

235
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:19,240
I will love you
until my heart stops beating

236
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:31,120
Through time and space
Yes, all my days…

237
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:34,880
–What? So you’ve changed your mind?
–No, I’ve always thought that.

238
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,640
–Of course everyone should get a chance.
–But how do we do that then?

239
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:40,120
Kiara. She’s a perfect member.

240
00:16:40,280 --> 00:16:44,080
She’s cool, rich, hot and diversity,
like the principal wants.

241
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:47,200
I really want to give her a chance.

242
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,760
You there, bitch ass. Move!

243
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,360
Nice dress you’ve got.

244
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:59,040
I would never have been comfortable
in that one.

245
00:16:59,200 --> 00:17:01,920
–Thanks!
–I just wanted to say you’re awesome.

246
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:06,960
–You think so?
–Yeah. I just need to keep a high level.

247
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Some people think I push
a bit too hard,

248
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,640
but it’s for Batgirls’ best.
Do you want to be in?

249
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,680
And dance? I didn’t think
I passed the audition.

250
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,040
I get to choose who I want.
You can take Adam’s spot.

251
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:23,760
I think it’s completely right for you.
Congratulations!

252
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,880
However, you have to dump
that nerd.

253
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,480
–What? Who?
–Come on, you get it.

254
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,760
The nerd. Lame-Alfred.

255
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:37,120
–Oh… Yeah.
–He’s not good for our reputation.

256
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,320
Hello, hello!
Can everyone look over here for a second?

257
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:43,040
So
I’ve dedicated a song

258
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,360
to a very special person
here inside.

259
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,320
Come! Let’s go.

260
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,520
I can only say this:
You know who you are.

261
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,720
Come on!

262
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:05,200
There’s a guy at this school
who’s obsessed with vampires

263
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,320
Kiara, why don’t you run away
Alfred has a bowl cut

264
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,920
Alfred is a nerd!

265
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:20,280
Alfred is a nerd!

266
00:18:20,440 --> 00:18:26,120
N-n-n-n-n-n-nerd! N-n-n-n-n-n-nerd!

267
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:30,040
Because Alfred is a nerd!

268
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:35,920
–Should we leave?
–Already? I thought they were pretty good.

269
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,480
Come on!

270
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,080
For Kiara he has feelings

271
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,720
but he always ends up in the friendzone

272
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,160
Kiara, get pepper spray
because Alfred wants to bang you

273
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:51,520
Alfred is a nerd!

274
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:57,440
Alfred, he’s disturbed!

275
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:03,520
N-n-n-n-n-n-nerd! N-n-n-n-n-n-nerd!

276
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:08,400
Because Alfred is a nerd!

277
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:15,480
No, not again.

278
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,400
/WET FART/

279
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:27,600
Because Alfred is a nerd!

280
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:33,080
–Want to borrow my hoodie, or?
–No, it’s fine.

281
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,720
But you can warm me up
in another way.

282
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:44,760
–So we’re back together!
–If everything wasn’t so complicated.

283
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:48,720
And if I just wasn’t
so damn clumsy all the time.

284
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:56,120
What are you looking at? Ignore them.

285
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,440
I don’t want to be like that,
but you should really go home now.

286
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:01,720
Shouldn’t you too? My parents
won’t notice anything.

287
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,920
–It’s not them I’m thinking about.
–Don’t worry about him.

288
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,600
Don’t worry
about a bloodthirsty big brother.

289
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,240
Please Alfred, you’re my guide.

290
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:14,560
Okay then.

291
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,480
It’s open.

292
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,040
–Eric! The gate is open!
–Come on, let’s go swimming!

293
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:25,160
Hi boys! Come on!

294
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:33,000
Damn, how childish!

295
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,000
Jump in then.
Vampires can’t handle water?

296
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:07,120
–Yeah, but I don’t want to get my hair wet.
–Bath wimp!

297
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,960
But tell me
why you like vampires so much.

298
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,800
Because they’re cool,
hot, rich, fast.

299
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,440
Thanks!

300
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,720
–Yo!
–Come on, tell me now.

301
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:31,320
Stop nagging.
I can’t be bothered to tell it.

302
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,240
Tell me why vampires
are so rich instead.

303
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:36,200
Now we’re doing the sauna, guys.

304
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,840
–Last one up is an idiot.
–Get up!

305
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,280
–No.
–Come on, let’s go!

306
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:50,360
–Damn, it’s so hot!
–Yeah thanks, I can see that.

307
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:53,120
–I can’t take any more.
–Damn, you’re so red.

308
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,480
–You too.
–Not as red.

309
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,560
–Don’t rub against me!
–It smells like balls in here.

310
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,720
–But now it’s your turn to tell.
–But it’s not that fun.

311
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:08,120
It’s kind of
a party killer actually.

312
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,000
Okay. Something happened
when I was little. An accident.

313
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,360
Hey there.

314
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,000
Damn, it’s so hot.
I’m so fucking sweaty.

315
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:27,800
Guys!

316
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,440
Guys! Guys!

317
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,840
Help! Help!

318
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,320
–Help!
–What are you doing?

319
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,360
Help! Help!

320
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,680
Eric!

321
00:22:46,840 --> 00:22:49,240
–Eric! Eric!
–Do something!

322
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:51,760
Help! Crisis-vamp!

323
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:13,440
