00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:04,600
Welcome back to the vampire channel
Blood, Sweat, Tears.

2
00:00:04,760 --> 00:00:06,560
Sensitive viewers are warned
about parties, bad jokes

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,400
and unfortunately way too little smut
for a vampire series.

4
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,720
This is Skaraborg High School.

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:13,520
Here you’ll find beauty queens,
emos, jocks, and troublemakers,

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,600
and the gossip spreads faster
than the school Wi-Fi.

7
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,320
There I am!
No, to the right—in the mascot costume.

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:20,080
Life is unfair.
But everything’s here:

9
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
Teenage feelings, teenage feelings,

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,520
Sweden’s best kebab sauce,
the school’s rice kids.

11
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,440
Relax. It’s just a regular math book.
Nothing else.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,560
Baddies with high body counts,
insanely much makeup

13
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,200
and nerds with sky-high high scores.

14
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:32,400
At this school rumors spread
faster than a virgin comes.

15
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:33,560
And speaking of coming!

16
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:36,440
Here come the number-one party planners,
with an IQ roughly on the same level.

17
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,320
So get ready for a new term
of Blood, Sweat, Tears.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,560
And to not miss anything,
subscribe to my channel.

19
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:45,200
I, your very own vampire researcher,
am ready with brand-new equipment.

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,360
Like! Follow!

21
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:48,320
–Hey, Alfred.
–Yo, Mr. Beast.

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,080
How’s it going?
Have you hit your 20th follower yet?

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,480
A vampire is starting at our school.
How cool is that?

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,600
I went and donated blood to the Blood System
just for today.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,000
Imagine! My blood will be eaten by
the vampires to keep them calm.

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,480
–And remember:
–Together we save lives.

27
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:07,480
They eat our blood and in return
their blood becomes medicine for us.

28
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,720
Humans and vampires side by side.

29
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:13,480
But one misstep and they
get triggered and bloodthirsty.

30
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:14,880
Today is the day we’ve all been waiting for,

31
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,880
when the vampire finally steps
out of the shadows.

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,480
Is it pale? Is it 200 years old?
Is it as powerful as Dracula?

33
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,360
And above all:
How big are the fangs?

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,560
Hi!

35
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,320
So many questions
and I’m going to find the answers.

36
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,320
See it? Or?
That’s the new vampire.

37
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,920
What?

38
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,480
–It’s fucking disgusting.
–Yeah, I think so too.

39
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,520
–Got any gum?
–Yeah.

40
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,480
Take another one then. Stinky!

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,280
How’s the vampire going to manage
among bandy guys and dance girls?

42
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:40,880
Here it’s not good grades that matter.

43
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,160
The absolute most important thing is
how good you are at your sport

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:46,760
and above all that you contribute
to the Skaraborg Bats trophy cabinet.

45
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,720
The guys are rock-hard
and the girls are as blonde

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,280
as their acrylic nails are sharp.

47
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:53,360
They call themselves Batgirls.
Ironically, since they love high UV.

48
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
This is humor, horror and drama.

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,400
This is Skaraborg High School.
This is Blood, Sweat, Tears.

50
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:01,440
And we’re kicking off
with our novella analyses.

51
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,480
–But first…
–I wouldn’t count on it.

52
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,000
Chloe…

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,280
Put the phone away.

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,400
First I’d like to introduce
your new classmate Kiara.

55
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:18,360
Can you tell us a bit about yourself?

56
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:23,200
Good morning!
My name is Kiara Natt och Dag.

57
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,960
Welcome to us!
And I’d like to remind everyone

58
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,160
that the politically correct term
is cold-blooded.

59
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:31,960
We don’t use the V-word.

60
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,800
It’s very important here now
that no one offends Kiara

61
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,440
because she’s a vampire.

62
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,400
Cause we are young,
wild, we are free

63
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,920
BST!

64
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:57,280
It's just the way
that it's supposed to be

65
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,240
BST!

66
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:10,840
Good morning… Good morning!
My name is Jonas, your substitute today.

67
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,880
Got called in at 02:00,
so I’m not in the greatest mood.

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,080
But as you know
we’ve got a vampire in the class,

69
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:19,520
so the school has decided to install
this kind of emergency vampire kit.

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,400
They get triggered by blood and sweat.

71
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,960
So you, chubby,
maybe shouldn’t stand so close.

72
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,760
Triggered means they go completely hysterical.

73
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,200
Like some people maybe get
once a month.

74
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,200
But like this,
you should absolutely not try this,

75
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,720
but I’m going to do it
just to be safe.

76
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:36,960
I pull it in and then…

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,120
Then you feel good.

78
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,960
Just press it
against her face

79
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
when she gets a bit crazy.

80
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,200
Just to be safe we’re going to run
this lesson on two separate halves

81
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,840
of the classroom
for your safety.

82
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,880
Because we don’t want her
running around going crazy.

83
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,240
Yes, and we have a responsibility
to offer schooling to cold-bloodeds too.

84
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,560
Diversity is our highest priority.

85
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,520
Hi, hi!

86
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,840
Organizing this year’s masquerade
as a project is super fun, Eric,

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
but as principal I would have preferred
you chose Religion 2.

88
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:20,880
But I get it.

89
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,680
I was also chair
of the party committee just like you, Eric.

90
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,120
Of course you should do it.
I remember it like it was yesterday.

91
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,680
Christer Wallgren…
Damn, what shoulders and fists.

92
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,680
He got both of them
in one grip.

93
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,920
But I’ve got
this diversity thing dumped in my lap.

94
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,320
It’s the school board.

95
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:51,560
And now! What we’ve all been waiting for.
A living, breathing female vampire.

96
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:04,000
Shit, seriously! I’m gonna see
if I can get a better shot.

97
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,640
What the hell…?

98
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,240
What the hell…?

99
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,720
–Hi!
–Ah!

100
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:40,440
Oh, sorry.
I didn’t mean to scare you.

101
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:43,160
I’m not really used to
being around humans.

102
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:45,360
Hehe… Me neither.

103
00:05:46,640 --> 00:05:48,640
–Watch out!
–Ah!

104
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,160
No, I’m just kidding.
We can handle crosses.

105
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:54,480
Okay. But silver then?

106
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,280
This isn’t real silver.

107
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:59,720
But what? It cost
a fortune!

108
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:05,120
Kiara Natt och Dag.

109
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:12,880
Cold… Cold-blooded…

110
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,600
What?

111
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,880
What the hell! You think this
is some kind of game? Then get lost!

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:22,760
I’m not taking responsibility
for any bloodbath.

113
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:26,360
Damn it…
You don’t want to mess with me, kid.

114
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:28,240
Stay away!

115
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:37,680
A cold-blood has started
at the school.

116
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,920
So it’s extra relevant right now.

117
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,600
Now it’s important to stroke with the fur.
That’s why you’re here, Elise.

118
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:47,400
As leader of the dance team Batgirls

119
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,160
you traditionally handle
the dance performance at the masquerade.

120
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:54,440
You’re gorgeous! You really are.

121
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,400
It’s hair and long legs
and… everything sits where it should.

122
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:01,080
But I’ll be honest.

123
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:04,000
It’s perceived
as too homogeneous a group

124
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,080
for the Batgirls finale show.

125
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:08,240
We don’t want the finale show
to be perceived that way, obviously.

126
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,200
The school board has decided
you need to hold an audition.

127
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:15,840
An open audition where everyone
gets the chance to perform.

128
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I know someone who’s going to be pissed.

129
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,560
Audition?! Fuck that!

130
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,360
Batgirls aren’t
just any damn bottom scrap.

131
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,120
But the principal has decided it.
I think it’s a good idea.

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,760
–No, I refuse.
–The principal has a point.

133
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:31,840
We can’t always pick
the most popular girls every time.

134
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,080
Why not?

135
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,560
It’ll be fairer
if the best dancers are in.

136
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:40,960
–As if you’re so damn good then.
–Eric, what do you say?

137
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,480
What?

138
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,040
I just think
I’m organizing the masquerade

139
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:46,200
and don’t have anything
to do with this.

140
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,840
–I really have to go now.
–No, you’re not going anywhere.

141
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:53,840
I’m obviously in anyway.
It’s not me who needs to worry.

142
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,280
Why didn’t you say anything?
Well, you were just standing there.

143
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,280
–I really need to talk to you.
–No time.

144
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,800
My life has changed.
I was literally about to die.

145
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,680
That’s probably super interesting,
but I have a bigger problem.

146
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,240
–What?
–What does homogay mean?

147
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,560
Homogay? What the hell are you talking about?

148
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,400
The principal says
she needs to see diversity.

149
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:13,680
She claims Elise
and the Batgirls are too homogay.

150
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,280
–You mean homogeneous?
–That’s what I said, right?

151
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,360
It’s just cute, blonde girls.

152
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,800
Think a bit more Pick’n’Mix.
A brunette wouldn’t hurt.

153
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,200
–Pick’n’Mix?
–I don’t have time, Eric.

154
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,160
We can’t let in
just any bottom scrap.

155
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,800
Look! There she is.

156
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,920
New girl, sit down.

157
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,120
Yeah, you. Sit.

158
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:50,240
What brand
is that on your bag?

159
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,440
–What?
–Nothing I’ve heard of.

160
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,960
Is it expensive?

161
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,880
–Do you think he’s hot?
–No. Or who?

162
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,760
So you think Eric is ugly?

163
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:14,520
Good thing I’m not on my period.
Then she might have gotten triggered and eaten me?

164
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:15,680
–Ew!
–Ew!

165
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,000
So, bleach-nose, that’s all.

166
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:21,960
–That’s your cue.
–You can go now.

167
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,320
What does human blood taste like?

168
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,480
Are there vegan vampires?

169
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,920
–Sorry. Maybe that was too personal.
–No, it’s fine.

170
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,560
Alfred Carlsson,
influencer, vampire researcher.

171
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,400
Vampire researcher? Sexy.

172
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,800
I’ve got a thing for vampires.
A fetish.

173
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:52,640
Or I mean fascination
for vampires… like you.

174
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,040
But guys too, though.

175
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,400
But I like girls, I mean.
Women, ladies…

176
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,400
–Yeah, you get it
–Hi, Alfred.

177
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,200
I get that all of this
feels overwhelming,

178
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,800
but you’re in safe hands.
I’m going to guide you.

179
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,680
I’m going to teach you everything I can, okay?

180
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:10,880
The ones you just sat with,
that’s the evil side of the dance crew.

181
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,840
Chloe is mad because she thinks
she’s the leader of Batgirls.

182
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,760
Over there is the good side
and there’s Elise.

183
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,680
She’s the leader of the good side,
and that’s why Chloe is mad.

184
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,080
They’re in the dance program.

185
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,880
There’s always drama
about who gets to be in

186
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,840
and who
doesn’t get to be in Batgirls.

187
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:31,120
–And who’s that?
–Who?

188
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:33,000
–Eric.
–Oh.

189
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,880
My childhood buddy Eric.

190
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,120
Yeah, he’s
Mr. Popular these days.

191
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:39,240
Especially
since he and Elise are together.

192
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:40,440
Oh, they’re together?

193
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,160
–Sometimes.
–Sometimes?

194
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,920
Yeah. Depends
on how much Eric screws up.

195
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,640
But what? Aren’t there only advantages
to being a vampire?

196
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,440
Well…

197
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,120
Don’t forget sunscreen.
At least SPF 100.

198
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,680
Always carry your umbrella.

199
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:01,480
And avoid sweaty environments
and people.

200
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,720
And remember,
a vampire always speaks the truth

201
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:06,400
and never goes anywhere
unless invited.

202
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:12,440
You’re sixteen, you’re not a hundred.
But you’ve never been to school.

203
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,000
And then over to those
four wine regions we talked about:

204
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:19,080
–Bordeaux, Burgundy, Alsace and…?
–Champagne.

205
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:22,120
Good! Straighten your back! Good.

206
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,800
What? If they finally agreed
to let you go to school,

207
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,280
why choose here?

208
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:34,160
Kiara, we’ve already talked about this.
The answer is still no.

209
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:38,160
Why do you even need to go to school?
You’re filthy rich anyway.

210
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,520
–I need 3,400 kr.
–I’ll write a check.

211
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,080
Transfer the money
to our Swiss bank account.

212
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,160
–900…
–Blood and honor.

213
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,680
…83…

214
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,120
So if I were to cut myself
and bleed a lot,

215
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,480
would you get triggered then?

216
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,640
Yeah, probably.

217
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,800
If I were super hot
and sweating a lot, then?

218
00:11:57,960 --> 00:12:00,040
–Same.
–Okay.

219
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,880
Super reflexes? No.

220
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,400
Man, what crap, right?
Who even wants to go there?

221
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,840
I can’t think of anything
I’d rather do than go there.

222
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,160
Exactly! Or what? You want to go?

223
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,480
I want to dance.
What do I have to do to join?

224
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:30,960
Well, to go to the masquerade
you just buy a ticket, but…

225
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:34,080
–And dance?
–No. Dancing, no way.

226
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
Sign up for the masquerade.

227
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,080
And sign up
for the Batgirls audition.

228
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
Hey, Affe. How’s it going?

229
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,200
Can’t you sign up
for the masquerade, please?

230
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,040
You can’t stay home
watching vampire porn again this year.

231
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,440
–Do you want to come to the masquerade?
–Yes, I’d love to.

232
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:52,520
I don’t think we’ve met.
Eric, team captain of Skaraborg Bats

233
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,960
and chair of the party committee.

234
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,680
–Kiara Natt och Dag.
–Are you the new girl?

235
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,160
–The new girl?
–Yeah.

236
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:01,160
–It’s Countess Kiara Natt och Dag.
–Well, look at that.

237
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:05,080
Then allow me with dignity
to invite the countess to a dance at the castle.

238
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:08,680
I also know cold-bloodeds
require an invitation, right?

239
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:12,400
Okay, Casanova, she gets it.

240
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,160
–Hi. Elise.
–Hi.

241
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,400
I’d like to sign up
for the masquerade and audition.

242
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,840
Okay, I don’t want to be that person,

243
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,200
but can cold-bloodeds
really dance with everyone?

244
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,280
Isn’t it risky
with sweat and all that?

245
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:30,560
–Well, technically. But I’ve got the vamp kit.
–Oh, okay. Welcome.

246
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:32,720
Watch out, Eric!

247
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:37,720
Cool!

248
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,400
What the hell?

249
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,200
–Damn, that’s cool!
–Really.

250
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,120
Are you coming to the party tonight?

251
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,960
No, Dracula Bride.
There’s a new season,

252
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,680
so I’m going home
to watch it actually.

253
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,760
I wasn’t talking to you.

254
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,760
It’s on the beach,
if you want to swing by.

255
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,440
I can’t.
My parents won’t let me.

256
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,160
Look. Here she comes.

257
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,960
Did Eric invite you
to the beach party?

258
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,640
Yeah, but I can’t.

259
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,080
–Exactly, because you’re not invited.
–And vampires aren’t welcome.

260
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:10,560
The beach party isn’t
for just anyone.

261
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,680
I heard
you want to audition.

262
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:16,880
We could use
some new blood in Batgirls.

263
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,120
–Can you dance?
–Yes. Ballet.

264
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:23,800
Ballet? Why am I not surprised?

265
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,920
See you at the dance school tomorrow then.
Changed and ready.

266
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,000
You can wear ballet clothes.

267
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:34,280
So, you can go now.

268
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:38,600
–You invited her.
–No, she got the time wrong.

269
00:14:38,760 --> 00:14:41,720
Just like with Linnéa.
The one who started crying.

270
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:46,000
Exactly. That’s not the only thing
that makes the bloodsucker cry.

271
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:46,160
Where’s Kiara? We can’t have
another accident, Jacques.

272
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,680
Your sister is your responsibility now.

273
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:09,520
Kiara…

274
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:16,360
Give me a K! Give me an Å!
Give me an R! What does that make?

275
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,720
Kår! (School spirit cheer)

276
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,240
Ah!

277
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,320
