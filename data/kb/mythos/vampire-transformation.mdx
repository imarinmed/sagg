### Description
In the dark adaptation, transformation is explicitly violent and sexual. The sire
must drain the human nearly to death, then share their blood in an act of reverse
feeding. The transition involves a death—the human dies, and what wakes is something
else wearing their face. Many new vampires struggle with what they've lost.

### Traits

- loss_of_humanity
- hunger_upon_waking
- eternal_servitude_to_sire
- identity_death

### Significance
Transformation raises the ultimate consent question: the human agrees to transform,
but the creature that wakes is not quite them. Did they consent to becoming a predator?
To losing their human life, loves, future? The power dynamic between sire and new
progeny mirrors abusive relationships, with the progeny dependent on their maker
for knowledge, protection, and often feeding in those first vulnerable nights.

### Mechanics
Transformation requires the human to be drained past the point of no return, then
fed vampire blood while the heart still weakly beats. The process takes three nights:
the first night the human dies, the second they sleep in the earth, the third they
rise as vampire. The sire must stay close during this time, as their blood calls
to the awakening progeny.

### Erotic Implications
Transformation is the ultimate consummation. Sires often choose lovers to turn,
creating an eternal partner bound to them by blood. The act itself—draining,
feeding, the three nights of intimacy—is intensely sexual for both parties.
Some vampires describe their transformation as the most erotic experience of
their existence, colored by the terror and ecstasy of death.
