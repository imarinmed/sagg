# Vampire Physiology

## Summary

Vampires in the series appear human but possess enhanced abilities and depend on blood for sustenance.
They can blend into human society and attend regular schools, making them virtually indistinguishable
from humans in everyday interactions.

Their bodies have adapted to process blood as their primary source of nutrition, converting its
components into the energy needed to sustain their enhanced abilities. The exact biological
mechanisms remain mysterious, but the results are undeniable: increased strength, heightened
senses, and extended lifespans that span centuries.

## SST

### Description
In the dark adaptation, vampire physiology becomes more explicitly tied to predatory nature.
The enhanced senses are heightened to predatory levels, allowing vampires to detect heartbeats,
fear hormones, and the subtle flush of arousal in human prey.

### Traits
- predatory_instincts
- feral_state_during_starvation
- inhuman_strength_potential
- immortal_perspective_on_mortal_fragility

### Significance
The power differential inherent in vampire physiology raises questions of consent
and equality in any vampire-human relationship. Can true consent exist when one
partner could physically overwhelm the other at any moment?

### Mechanics
Blood consumption not only sustains but enhances. Recent feeding amplifies all abilities,
while blood deprivation leads to a feral state where instinct overrides reason.

### Erotic Implications
The heightened senses make vampires exquisitely attuned to physical pleasure and pain.
Their enhanced stamina and strength open possibilities for intense physical encounters
that would be dangerous or impossible with human partners.
