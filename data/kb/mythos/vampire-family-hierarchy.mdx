The hierarchy extends beyond blood relations to include turned vampires, who owe
allegiance to their sires, and human servants who serve the family. Position in the
hierarchy is determined by age, power, and the prestige of one's lineage.

### Description
In the dark adaptation, family hierarchy takes on totalitarian dimensions. The head
of family has absolute authority over members' lives, including rights to feed from
them, arrange their marriages, and discipline them physically. Rebellion is rare
because it typically ends in death or exile—which for a vampire often means the same thing.

### Traits
- loss_of_bodily_autonomy
- arranged_matings_without_consent
- punishment_through_blood_bond
- familial_abuse_normalized

### Significance
The family structure creates power imbalances that would be recognized as abusive
in human contexts. Young vampires have little recourse against elders' demands.
The conflation of family, feeding, and sexuality creates situations where boundaries
become impossible to maintain or even identify.

### Mechanics
Hierarchy follows strict rules: sire over progeny, elder over younger, direct bloodline
over turned. Within the same generation, power determines rank. Challenges to hierarchy
must be formal, witnessed, and often deadly. The head of family can command any member
through the blood bond, making resistance physiologically difficult.

### Erotic Implications
Family hierarchy extends into intimate matters. Arranged matings serve political purposes,
and young vampires may be forbidden from pursuing attractions that don't benefit the family.
In some families, elders claim "rights" to sample progeny before allowing them to mate.
The incestuous undertones of vampire families—where one might mate with someone their
sire once fed from or bedded—are rarely discussed but ever-present.
