# Vampire-Human Relations

## Summary

Vampires coexist secretly with humans, attending the same schools and living in the
same communities. Most humans are unaware of vampires' existence, enabling vampires
to move freely among their prey while maintaining the masquerade.

This coexistence creates unique tensions. Vampires must constantly restrain their
nature, while any human who discovers the truth faces a choice: become part of
vampire society or be silenced. Romance between vampires and humans is particularly
fraught, carrying existential implications for both parties.

### Description
In the dark adaptation, vampire-human relationships become explicitly about power and
consumption. Humans who enter vampire society do so as servants, donors, or pets.
True equality is impossible when one partner could kill the other on a whim—or worse,
turn them into an eternal subordinate.

### Traits
- humans_as_cattle_perspective
- loss_of_humanity_in_relationships
- addiction_to_vampire_attention
- isolation_from_human_world

### Significance
Can a relationship ever be consensual when one partner is prey? The vampire's
self-control is always tested, and the human's life always at risk. Some vampires
fetishize human fragility, while some humans fetishize vampire power. Neither
dynamic leads to healthy relationships by human standards—but vampire standards
are different, and perhaps human morality doesn't apply.

### Mechanics
Humans who learn about vampires are given limited options: serve, be thralled (have
their memories modified), or die. Those who choose to serve enter a society where
they have fewer rights than the lowest vampire. Human lovers are often viewed by
vampire society as either future prey or future progeny—never equals.

### Erotic Implications
The power differential creates intense dynamics. Some humans are drawn to vampires
precisely because of the danger, seeking the thrill of intimacy with a predator.
Vampires may view human lovers as beloved pets or forbidden fruit—the attraction
heightened by the taboo. Cross-species romance often involves elements of feeding,
blurring lines between sex and sustenance.
