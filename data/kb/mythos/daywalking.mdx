### Description
In the dark adaptation, daywalking is not universal. Most vampires suffer weakness
in direct sunlight—not death, but discomfort and reduced powers. True daywalkers
are rare, often the result of powerful bloodlines or mysterious mutations. They
are prized as mates and feared as hunters, able to strike when other vampires sleep.

### Traits
- nowhere_is_safe
- predator_in_broad_daylight
- false_sense_of_security_for_humans
- evolutionary_advantage_in_hunting

### Significance
Daywalking challenges human assumptions about safety. Traditionally, daylight
meant sanctuary—a time when vampires couldn't touch you. Daywalkers remove that
protection, making humans vulnerable around the clock. The psychological impact
on humans who learn about daywalkers is profound: there is no escape, no safe time.

### Mechanics
Daywalking ability runs in bloodlines. The Natt och Dag family possesses it through
ancient ancestry, giving them advantages in vampire politics. Daywalkers can sense
other daywalkers, recognizing each other as equals in a world where most vampires
are bound by night. Some theorize daywalking comes from dhampir ancestry.

### Erotic Implications
Daywalker vampires can pursue human lovers during normal hours, joining them for
lunch dates and afternoon trysts that nocturnal vampires miss. This creates a
different dynamic—less mysterious midnight visits, more normalized integration
of feeding into everyday intimacy. Sun-warmed vampire skin feels almost human.
