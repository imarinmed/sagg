### Description

**Identity & Background**  
Alfred is introduced as an unpopular student at Skaraborg High who openly describes himself as having a "fascination/fetish for vampires." [s01e01] He runs a YouTube channel focused on vampire research and documentation, though it has only approximately 20 followers—a running joke about his lack of influence. [s01e01] His outsider status makes him sympathetic to Kiara's struggles as a vampire trying to integrate into human high school.

**Character Traits**  
- **Academic Curiosity**: Approaches vampire culture with genuine research interest, asking questions and documenting findings
- **Social Awkwardness**: Nerdy, unpopular, lacks the social capital of athletes like Eric or popular students
- **Authenticity**: Unlike other students who navigate vampire-human relations carefully, Alfred is direct about his interest in vampires
- **Loyalty**: Becomes Kiara's most consistent ally and friend despite social consequences

**Key Relationships**  
- **Kiara Natt och Dag**: His relationship with her evolves from research subject to friend to romantic interest. He is invited to lunch at the Natt och Dag estate [s01e03], where he learns about the family's history (grandmother killing Dracula, the stake relic, the 1327 estate origins). Their connection deepens across the season.
- **Kevin**: Fellow student, connected through school social circles [s01e01]
- **Eric**: Indirect connection through the Eric-Kiara incident; Alfred's perspective as human observer becomes important

**Major Events**  
- **Episode 1**: Introduced as vampire researcher/influencer, meets Kiara
- **Episode 2**: Continues documenting vampire culture, relationship with Kiara develops
- **Episode 3**: Invited to lunch at Natt och Dag estate, meets Kiara's grandmother, learns family history (Dracula's death, the stake, 1327 origins, matriarchal traditions)
- **Episode 4**: Present at Kiara's estate party where Kevin brings "Vamp" drug; observes vampire-human social mixing
- **Episode 5**: Attends warehouse party, continues documenting vampire integration
- **Episode 6**: His drunk rant goes viral (content suggests criticism of vampire-human relations or defense of Kiara after Eric incident); becomes public figure temporarily
- **Episode 7**: Aftermath of viral video, navigates public attention while supporting Kiara's masquerade attendance

**Human Perspective on Vampire World**  
Alfred serves as the audience surrogate, asking questions about:
- **Blood System**: Symbiotic relationship where humans donate blood, receive vampire blood as medicine [s01e01]
- **Triggering**: Vampires become bloodthirsty from blood + sweat combination [s01e01]
- **Truth Rule**: "A vampire always speaks the truth" [s01e01]
- **Invitation Rule**: Vampires cannot enter without invitation [s01e01]
- **Terminology**: "Cold-blooded" (PC) vs "vampire" (V-word, offensive to humans but pride for vampires) [s01e01]
- **Matriarchal Inheritance**: Youngest daughter inherits everything [s01e04]
- **Peace Treaty**: Blood pact ended human-vampire killing era [s01e04]

### Description

In the dark adaptation, Alfred's character becomes a lens for exploring the ethics and erotics of vampire-human power imbalances. His "vampire research" is reframed not as innocent academic curiosity but as an intense sexual fetish—the human who fantasizes about surrender to supernatural predators.

**Fetish & Obsession**  
Alfred's YouTube channel transforms from quirky documentation to voyeuristic observation. His admission of "fascination/fetish" [s01e01] is taken literally: he is aroused by vampire power, by the danger of intimacy with beings who could drain him. His low follower count suggests this isn't just intellectual—it's personal, niche, potentially shameful.

**Power Exchange Dynamics**  
The relationship with Kiara explores:
- **Consent Under Duress**: Can a human truly consent to intimacy with a vampire when there's inherent power imbalance?
- **Fetish vs. Reality**: Alfred fantasizes about vampire domination; Kiara's actual triggering in the sauna [s01e03] shows the terrifying reality
- **Observation & Performance**: His documentation becomes voyeuristic—filming, watching, studying vampire bodies and behaviors
- **Submission & Control**: Alfred's desire to surrender versus Kiara's need to maintain control (anti-trigger medication, ballet discipline)

**The Viral Rant**  
In Episode 6, Alfred's drunk rant goes viral. [s01e06] The dark adaptation explores this as a public humiliation moment:
- **Shame Kink**: Public exposure of his vampire obsession, potential arousal from being watched/judged
- **Parasocial Dynamics**: His tiny YouTube audience explodes—sudden visibility of his private desires
- **Defense of Kiara**: If the rant defends her after Eric's hospitalization, it becomes a public declaration of loyalty/devotion

**Estate Lunch Scene**  
The invitation to the Natt och Dag estate [s01e03] takes on erotic undertones:
- **Threshold Crossing**: Entering vampire space, the invitation rule's symbolic significance (permission, consent, access)
- **Grandmother's Story**: Learning about the stake that killed Dracula—penetration as female power, the erotics of vampire death
- **Private Space**: Alfred gains access to Kiara's aristocratic world, an intimacy that crosses class and species boundaries

**"Homo Vampyrus"**  
The scientific terminology for vampires [s01e05] reinforces Alfred's academic framing. In the dark adaptation, this becomes part of his fetish—clinical language as distancing mechanism, objectification as arousal strategy.
