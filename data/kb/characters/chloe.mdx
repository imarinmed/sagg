### Description
Chloe is introduced in Episode 1 as a member of the Batgirls who believes she should be the crew's leader, positioning her in opposition to Elise's "good side" leadership. She is explicitly associated with the "evil side" faction of the Batgirls, suggesting a schism within the dance crew.

Throughout Season 1, Chloe acts as an antagonist to Kiara, engaging in social manipulation and schemes designed to embarrass or undermine the vampire newcomer. In Episode 3, she tricks Kiara into overdressing for a village hall party (bygdegårdsfest), demonstrating her willingness to use deception for social sabotage.

The Episode 8 finale at the masquerade ball includes a revelation of Chloe's secret, though the specific nature of this secret is not detailed in available transcript evidence. Context suggests it relates to her behavior toward Kiara and possibly involves supernatural or erotic elements.

## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation reframes Chloe's antagonism as a manifestation of obsessive desire masked as hatred—the classic "hate-to-love" dynamic taken to transgressive extremes. Her belief that she is the rightful Batgirls leader becomes a struggle not just for social status but for dominance, recognition, and the right to command attention and submission.

The "evil side" faction of the Batgirls is reimagined as a space for transgressive desires—the rejection of respectability, the embrace of darker impulses, and the exploration of power through performance. Chloe's schemes to embarrass Kiara are reframed as testing boundaries, probing vulnerabilities, and engaging in a form of erotic warfare where humiliation and desire are intertwined.

Her Episode 8 secret is reimagined as an "observer kink"—Chloe has been voyeuristically watching Kiara and Alfred, documenting their relationship, perhaps even their intimate moments. Her antagonism stems not from pure hatred but from fascination, envy, and a compulsion to witness what she cannot or will not claim for herself. The revelation becomes a moment of public exposure that mirrors her own acts of exposure and humiliation toward Kiara.

The adaptation explores themes of desire-through-antagonism, voyeurism, public humiliation, and the tension between wanting to destroy what you cannot possess and wanting to possess what you claim to hate.

### Divergences from BST
- **Antagonism as Masked Desire**: Hatred reframed as obsessive fascination and repressed attraction.
- **Leadership Claim as Dominance Struggle**: Social competition becomes explicit struggle for power and recognition.

- **Episode 8 Secret as Observer Kink**: Voyeuristic documentation of Kiara/Alfred relationship, fascination with their intimacy.
- **Schemes as Erotic Warfare**: Humiliation tactics reframed as boundary-testing and desire expression.

### Erotic Implications
- **Voyeurism and Observation**: Secret watching, documentation, compulsion to witness.
- **Desire-Through-Hatred**: Antagonism as expression of repressed attraction.
- **Public Humiliation**: Schemes designed to embarrass become expressions of erotic power.
- **Dominance and Recognition**: Leadership struggle as desire for control and submission from others.
- **Transgressive Performance**: Evil-side faction as space for exploring taboo desires through choreographed dominance.

### Taboo Elements
