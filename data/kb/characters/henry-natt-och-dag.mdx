### Description

**Role in Family Hierarchy**  
Henry is the patriarch of the Natt och Dag family, one of the oldest and most powerful vampire lineages. At 45 years old (SST: 47), he stands as the ultimate authority figure within the family. [s01e01, s01e04] His word is law, and family tradition—including the matriarchal inheritance system—is upheld through his authority. [s01e04]

**Personality & Values**  
Henry is defined by strict adherence to tradition and absolute control:
- **Protective but Controlling**: Views family protection as justification for total authority
- **Traditional Vampire Values**: Upholds ancient family customs and hierarchies
- **Patriarch**: Expects complete obedience from all family members
- **Distant from Emotion**: Relationships are structured around duty and hierarchy, not warmth

**Relationship with Kiara**  
As Kiara's father, Henry maintains a controlling presence even when absent. He monitors her behavior through Jacques, enforces strict rules about her human school experience, and ultimately controls her major life decisions. [s01e01, s01e06, s01e07] His approval is required for major family actions.

**Relationship with Other Family Members**  
- **Desiree** (Wife): A distant partnership built on alliance and duty, not romance
- **Jacques** (Brother): A complicated rivalry involving family power dynamics and inheritance resentment

### Source Episodes
- **s01e01**: Referenced as the family authority establishing rules
- **s01e04**: Hosts family gathering, enforces matriarchal inheritance tradition
- **s01e06**: Confronts Kiara about her behavior and relationship with Alfred
- **s01e07**: Issues ultimatum regarding family loyalty

### Description

In the dark adaptation, Henry transforms from a stern but merely traditional patriarch into a figure of psychological complexity and dark authority. His control becomes explicitly erotic, his protection masking possession, and his strict discipline concealing repressed desires that emerge through his relationship with his daughter.

**Patriarchal Control as Kink**  
Henry's absolute authority over his family operates at intensity 5—not as mere tradition but as a source of sexual gratification. The control manifests through:
- **Glamour & Compulsion**: Uses vampire abilities to enforce obedience
- **Sire Bonds**: Maintains supernatural connection and control over progeny
- **Ownership Mentality**: Literally views family members as his property
- **Strict Discipline**: Corrects "misbehavior" through authoritarian punishment

**The Repressed Patriarch**  
Henry's repressed desires create a psychological undertow beneath his strict exterior. His intense monitoring of Kiara's relationship with Alfred [s01e06-s01e07], his ultimatums, and his possessive concern contain undercurrents of inappropriate attraction masked as paternal concern. The adaptation allows exploration of:
- Incestuous undertones in father-daughter dynamics
- Authority abuse couched in protection
- The use of discipline and correction as expressions of forbidden desire

**Power Dynamics & Hierarchy**  
Henry represents the vampire hierarchy's darkest aspects:
- Views hierarchy as justification for absolute power
- Uses traditional values as a mask for possessiveness
- Maintains control through combination of family duty and supernatural compulsion
- Sees his role as owner rather than protector

**Conflicts & Motivations**  
- **Kiara's Rebellion**: Her human school experience and interest in Alfred directly challenge his authority [s01e06]
- **Jacques's Resentment**: His brother's bitterness about matriarchal inheritance creates a rival power center
- **Maintaining the Line**: Fear of family corruption through human influence drives his controlling behavior
