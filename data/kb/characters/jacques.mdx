# Jacques Natt och Dag

## Summary

Kiara's brother and a prominent member of the Natt och Dag vampire lineage. While canonically a protective yet resentful sibling, the dark adaptation transforms him into a corrupting influence and a rival to his father's authority.

## BST

### Description
Jacques is introduced as the brother tasked with keeping Kiara in line as she navigates human school. He is deeply affected by the family's "Matriarchal Inheritance" rule, which dictates that the youngest daughter inherits everything, leaving him with little status despite his age and lineage.

### Source Episodes
- s01e01: Introduced as Kiara's brother.
- s01e04: Expresses resentment over inheritance rules.

## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation leans heavily into Jacques's role as an outcast and a rebel. He uses his charm and vampire abilities to manipulate those around him. His relationship with Kiara is charged with sexual tension and the shared secret of a blood bond, which he uses to undermine Henry's control over her. He is the embodiment of the "Level 5 - Taboo" darkness spectrum.
