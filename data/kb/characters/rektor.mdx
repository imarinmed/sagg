# Rektor (Principal)

## Summary

The administrative head of Skaraborg High. She balances the school's obsession with sports trophies with modern diversity requirements, often at the expense of the vampire students' well-being.

## BST

### Description
The Principal is a pragmatic administrator. In the first episode, she mandates that the Batgirls dance crew hold open auditions to increase diversity, which allows Kiara to join. However, following the incident where Eric is hospitalized, she immediately bans vampires from the school masquerade, only relenting after Eric's public speech.

### Source Episodes
- s01e01: Orders open auditions for Batgirls.
- s01e06: Bans vampires from the masquerade.
- s01e07: Forced to allow Kiara back after Eric's speech.

## SST

### Description
In the dark adaptation, the Principal's actions are framed as part of a larger "Blood System" bureaucracy that seeks to keep vampires "calm" and subservient. Her decision to ban Kiara is not just about safety, but about maintaining a human-centric power structure. She is a psychological antagonist who uses rules to inflict emotional harm.
