# Elise

## Summary

## BST

### Description
Elise is introduced as the leader of the Batgirls' good-side faction, positioned in opposition to Chloe's leadership claims. She is dating Eric, the team captain of the Skaraborg Bats and chair of the party committee, though their relationship experiences drama throughout the season.

Elise serves as a relatively friendly presence for Kiara as she enters the school's social world, offering guidance and support as the vampire student attempts to join the Batgirls. Her leadership style appears inclusive and mentoring, contrasting with Chloe's more antagonistic approach.

In Episode 7, Elise demonstrates impressive physical capabilities when she saves Kevin and Didde from thugs using her fighting skills, revealing a protective and capable side beyond her role as dance crew leader.

## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation transforms Elise's "good side" leadership into a complex performance of control and respectability. Her public persona as the responsible, inclusive leader masks deeper desires for dominance and possession. The Batgirls become a vehicle not just for social status but for the expression of power dynamics—choreographed dominance, physical control, and the hierarchy of bodies.

Her relationship with Eric becomes explicitly about power struggle. The "on-again, off-again" dynamic is reframed as a negotiation of sexual and social control. When Eric dances with Kiara at the warehouse party, Elise's anger is not just jealousy but territorial assertion—her claim on both Eric and her position in the social hierarchy.

Her mentorship of Kiara carries undertones of same-sex attraction and the tension between protective care and possessive desire. The adaptation explores whether Elise's support is genuine kindness or a strategic move to control a potential rival while satisfying her fascination with vampire otherness.

Her fighting skills in Episode 7—saving Kevin and Didde—become a display of physical dominance and the erotics of protective violence. The scene is reimagined with explicit attention to physicality, control, and the rush of power that comes from protecting the vulnerable through force.

### Divergences from BST
- **Leadership as Performance**: Good-side leadership masks desires for control and dominance.
- **Eric Relationship as Power Struggle**: Romance reframed as negotiation of sexual and social dominance.
- **Kiara Mentorship with Same-Sex Tension**: Protective care mixed with possessive attraction to vampire otherness.
- **Fighting Skills as Erotic Dominance**: Physical prowess becomes vehicle for exploring violence and protection as intertwined desires.
- **Batgirls as Control Hierarchy**: Dance crew becomes explicit exploration of physical dominance and body hierarchy.

### Erotic Implications
- **Dominance through Care**: Mentorship as vehicle for control and possession.
- **Physical Violence as Attraction**: Fighting skills reimagined as expressions of protective dominance.
- **Same-Sex Desire**: Tension between Elise and Kiara explores boundaries of friendship and attraction.
- **Social Hierarchy as Sexual Power**: Status and popularity become expressions of erotic control.
