### Description

In the dark adaptation, Didde's character is intensified as a physical enforcer within the school's social hierarchy. His jock persona becomes more menacing, with an emphasis on physical intimidation and the use of strength to control others. He represents the brutal enforcement mechanisms of the "mean girls" social circle, providing muscle and physical dominance as a key aspect of their power structure. His simplicity becomes more sinister—a tool for being easily manipulated by stronger personalities while using his physical presence to intimidate those weaker than him.
