This is a fundamental supernatural restriction in the vampire physiology itself, not merely a social convention. The rule functions as a consent-based entry mechanism, allowing humans to maintain control over their private spaces. Invitation creates a supernatural exception to the vampire's natural inability to cross the threshold."

# Invitation Rule

## Summary

A supernatural restriction that prevents vampires from entering private residences without being invited by an authorized resident. In the BST, this is an absolute physical law. In the dark adaptation, it becomes a metaphor for consent, control, and violation—a boundary that can be negotiated, manipulated, or catastrophically breached.

## BST

### Description
Vampires possess an absolute supernatural prohibition against entering a private home without an explicit invitation. This is not a matter of strength or will—no vampire, regardless of age or power, can overcome this restriction. The invitation must come from someone with authority over the space (the owner or an authorized resident). Once given, the restriction is lifted for that vampire; once withdrawn, it returns.

This rule establishes a crucial element of vampire-human relations: humans retain control over their most intimate spaces. It is a cornerstone of the social contract that allows humans and vampires to coexist, and it is deeply respected as an immutable law of vampire physiology.

### Source Episodes
- **s01e01**: The invitation rule is introduced as a fundamental aspect of vampire-human cohabitation. Characters demonstrate their knowledge of and respect for this law.
- **s01e05**: The rule's continued relevance is reinforced in vampire-human interactions. The invitation mechanism is shown to be absolute and unbreakable.

### Significance
The invitation rule represents the contractual foundation of peace between humans and vampires. It acknowledges vampire predatory nature while establishing clear boundaries that protect human autonomy and safety. The rule is so fundamental to vampire society that its violation would constitute one of the gravest transgressions.

## SST

### Description
In the dark adaptation, the invitation rule transforms from a protective boundary into a mechanism of seduction, possession, and control. An invitation is not merely permission to enter a room—it is an act of profound vulnerability. By inviting a vampire into one's home, a human signals trust, desire, or desperate need.

The dark version emphasizes the psychological stakes: once invited, a vampire has privileged access to one's intimate space, one's sanctuary. Withdrawal of an invitation becomes a form of banishment and rejection. Breaking the rule—forcing entry without invitation—represents violation at the deepest level: not just physical trespass, but a shattering of psychological safety.

### Consent Mechanics
In SST, the invitation rule becomes inseparable from questions of consent:
- **Deliberate Invitation**: An act of choice and conscious vulnerability, often laden with desire or desperation
- **Coerced Invitation**: Given under duress, compulsion, or predatory pressure
- **Invitation Under False Pretenses**: When the human doesn't fully understand what inviting a vampire into their home means
- **Revocation**: The human's final recourse to regain control and expel a vampire, but often comes too late or at great cost

### Power Dynamics
The invitation rule creates unique power imbalances:
- A young, inexperienced human inviting an ancient vampire into their home
- A vampire's slow seduction that culminates in a moment of vulnerable invitation
- The psychological hook: once invited, the vampire becomes synonymous with the home itself
- Older vampires using invitation as a form of territorial claim or possession

### Erotic Implications
The invitation becomes a sexual threshold:
- The moment of invitation mirrors the moment of sexual consent, carrying similar weight and finality
- Seduction narratives culminate in the human inviting the vampire across the threshold
- The intimate space of the home becomes a stage for erotic power play
- Some vampires use repeated invitations and revocations as a form of control and psychological manipulation
- The act of "being allowed in" carries erotic charge for both predator and prey

### Taboo Potential
The dark adaptation explores forbidden territory:
- **Violation Through Breaking**: A vampire forcing entry without invitation is a sexual and psychological assault—not merely physical trespass, but a shattering of autonomy
- **Manipulation Through Invitation**: A vampire grooming a human toward inviting them in, understanding the psychological hooks this creates
- **Possession Through Residence**: A vampire who becomes a permanent resident gains a form of ownership over the human and their space
- **Revocation as Rejection**: The cruelty of a human withdrawing an invitation, forcing a vampire to leave—a form of abandonment or punishment
- **The Threshold as Liminal Space**: Moments when a vampire is invited but hasn't fully crossed, where human and vampire exist in negotiation, suspended between danger and desire

### Significance in Dark Adaptation
The invitation rule in SST becomes a crystalline metaphor for all consent dynamics in relationships marked by predatory power. Every invitation carries the shadow of potential violation. Every revocation carries the weight of abandonment. The rule that was meant to protect humans becomes the stage upon which complex, sometimes beautiful, sometimes devastating power dynamics are played out.
