    description: "A traditional rule of the Natt och Dag family, in place since 1327. It dictates that the youngest daughter inherits the family name, title, and all assets. Husbands who marry into the family must take the Natt och Dag name. This rule creates significant tension, particularly for male siblings like Jacques."

    description: "In the dark adaptation, this rule is a source of 'Level 5 - Taboo' family dynamics. The inheritance is not just of property, but of a dark biological and ritualistic legacy. The youngest daughter is groomed from birth to lead, creating a toxic environment of sibling rivalry and patriarchal resentment."

# Matriarchal Inheritance

## Summary

The unique and ancient succession law of the Natt och Dag vampire lineage. It prioritizes the youngest female descendant, ensuring that power remains within a specific matriarchal line.

## BST

### Description
The Natt och Dag family has followed a matriarchal inheritance system for nearly seven centuries. According to this tradition, the youngest daughter is the sole heir to the family's vast wealth, including the ancestral estate and the family title. This system is absolute; even husbands must abandon their own names to become part of the Natt och Dag lineage. This creates a power imbalance within the family, as seen with Kiara's brother Jacques, who is excluded from the inheritance despite his age.

## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation explores the "Level 2 - Emotional" trauma caused by this system. The inheritance is seen as a burden as much as a privilege, involving the transfer of dark secrets and the responsibility of maintaining the family's predatory status. The resentment of the excluded male members is a recurring theme, leading to "Level 5 - Taboo" betrayals and power struggles.
