    description: "Vampires, or 'Homo vampyrus,' are 'cold-blooded' beings with several distinct traits. They possess dark vision, require SPF 100+ sun protection, and are subject to the 'Invitation Rule' (cannot enter without being invited). A unique emotional trait is that they cry only when they are truly in love. They are also bound by the 'Truth Rule,' meaning they always speak the truth."

    description: "The dark adaptation emphasizes the predatory and alien nature of vampire biology. The 'Truth Rule' is depicted as a biological compulsion that can be weaponized, and the 'Invitation Rule' is a psychological barrier. The act of crying when in love is a rare, visceral moment of 'Level 2 - Emotional' vulnerability in an otherwise predatory existence."
    divergences:
    - More visceral depiction of biological traits
    - Focus on the limitations and compulsions of the vampire state

### Description
Vampires in the series are a distinct species, *Homo vampyrus*. Their biology includes several supernatural and physical constraints:
- **Dark Vision**: The ability to see clearly in total darkness.
- **Sun Sensitivity**: Requires extreme protection (SPF 100+ and umbrellas) to avoid harm.
- **Triggering**: A state of bloodlust induced by the combination of blood and sweat.
- **Invitation Rule**: A mystical constraint preventing entry into a human residence without an explicit invitation.
- **Truth Rule**: A cultural or biological mandate that vampires must always speak the truth.
- **Emotional Crying**: Vampires do not produce tears unless they are experiencing true love.

### Description
In the dark adaptation, these biological traits are explored through the lens of "Level 3 - Horror." The "Triggering" state is a metaphor for loss of control and addiction. The "Truth Rule" is not a noble trait but a dangerous lack of a filter that leads to "Level 1 - Psychological" conflict. The physical needs of the vampire are depicted as demanding and often at odds with human morality.
