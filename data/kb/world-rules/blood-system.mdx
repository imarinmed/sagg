    description: "The 'Blood System' is the societal framework governing the symbiotic relationship between humans and vampires. It was established by a 'Blood Pact' that ended the era of mutual killing. Humans donate blood to keep vampires calm and integrated, while vampire blood is processed into medicine for humans. The system also has administrative powers, such as filing child welfare reports for rule-breaking vampires."

    description: "In the dark adaptation, the Blood System is a tool of systemic control and exploitation. The 'symbiosis' is shown to be a parasitic relationship where human blood is a commodity and vampire blood is a highly addictive drug. The administrative power of the system is used to enforce segregation and maintain a fragile, oppressive peace."

# Blood System

## Summary

The legal and biological framework that allows humans and vampires to coexist. It is based on a historical treaty known as the Blood Pact, which replaced violence with a regulated exchange of biological resources.

## BST

### Description
The Blood System ensures that vampires (referred to as "cold-blooded") have access to human blood donations, which are necessary to prevent them from being "triggered" by the scent of blood and sweat. In exchange, vampire blood is used to create potent medicines for humans. This symbiosis is the foundation of modern society in the series. The system is not just biological but also administrative, with the power to monitor vampire behavior and intervene in family matters through child welfare reports.

## SST

### Description
The dark adaptation portrays the Blood System as a "Level 1 - Psychological" and "Level 2 - Emotional" instrument of repression. The blood donations are often coerced or taken from the marginalized, and the "medicine" derived from vampires is depicted as a high-potency drug ("Vamp") that creates a class of human addicts. The system's goal is not harmony, but the management of a predatory species through chemical and legal shackles.
